Glimpse S-MAL: O6e86c57385d26a59c0df1580454b9967 S-MD5. O

Glimpse S-MALis Oa OPowerShell S-TOOLscript Othat Ois Oexecuted Osilently Oby OVisual B-TOOLBasic E-TOOLscript O. O

Based Oon Othe Ocode, Oit Ois Ounclear Owhat Oinitiates Othe OVisual B-TOOLBasic E-TOOLscript Oitself O. O

However, Oa Ovariety Oof Otypical Opersistence Omechanisms, Osuch Oas Oa Oscheduled Otask, Ocould Oserve Othat Opurpose. O

After OGlimpse S-MALstarts, Oit Ochecks Ofor Othe Oexistence Oof Oa Odirectory Oand Olock Ofile. O

If Ono Odirectory Oor Olock Ofile Ois Ofound, OGlimpse S-MALcreates Oone. O

Alternatively, Oif Othese Odo Oexist Oand Othe Olock Ofile Ois Oolder Othan O10 Ominutes, Othe Olock Ofile Ois Odeleted Oand Othe Opreviously Orunning OGlimpse S-MALscript Ois Okilled. O

After Othe Oinitial Ochecks Odescribed Oabove, OGlimpse S-MALcreates Oa Ohidden Ofile Othat Ocontains Oan Oagent OID, Owhich Ois Oa Osimple Oconcatenation Oof Oa Orandom Onumber O10-99 Oand Othe Ofirst O8 Ocharacters Oof Oa OGUID S-TOOLwithout Odashes. O

The Omethods Oemployed Oby OGlimpse S-MALto Operform ODNS PROTcommunications Oare Odetermined Oby Othe Omode Oin Owhich Oit Ois Ooperating O(i.e., Otext Omode Oor Oping Omode) O. O

In Otext Omode, OGlimpse S-MALmanually Obuilds B-ACTa I-ACTDNS I-ACTquery E-ACTto Obe Otransmitted Oover Oa OUDP B-TOOLsocket E-TOOL. O

In Oping Omode, OGlimpse S-MALuses Oa B-FILE.NET E-FILEmethod. O

The Otable Obelow Odescribes Othe Ooperational Omode, Orecord Otypes Oused, Oand Othe Omethod Oused Oto Osend Othe Oquery. O

The Ofirst ODNS PROTquery Oby OGlimpse S-MALrequests Othe Omode Oto Obe Oused Oin Ofuture Ocommunications Owith Othe Ocontroller O(i.e., Oping Omode Oor Otext Omode) O. O

Prior Oto Omaking Oany Oquery, Oa Ofunction Ocalled OAdrGen Ois Oused Oto Obuild Oa Oquery Ostring. O

This Ofunction Otakes Oseveral Oparameters, Omost Oof Owhich Oare Orepresented Oin Othe Osubdomain Olabel(s) Oof Othe Oquery Ostring. O

Below Ois Oa Olist Oof OAdrGen Oparameters. O

As Omentioned Oabove, Oone Oof Othe Oparameters Opassed Oto Othe OAdrGen Ofunction Ois Othe Oaction Oparameter. O

Table O5: OGlimpse S-MALaction Oparameters Ovalues Ofor Othe OAdrGen Ofunction Obelow Ocontains Othe Opossible Oparameters, Oa Obrief Odescription, Oand Oreturn Ovalues Oapplicable Oto Othe Oaction Oparameter. O

The Oquery Oto Oset Othe Oreceive Omode Oexpects Oan OA Oresource Orecord Oresponse Ofrom Othe Ocontroller. O

The Ocontroller Owill Orespond Owith Oone Oof Otwo Oresponses: O99.250.250.199 S-IPwill Oset Othe Oreceive Omode Oto Otext. O

Any Oother OIP Oaddress Owill Oset Othe Oreceive Omode Oto Oping, Oalthough Othe Oserver-side Osoftware Osuggests O199.250.250.99 S-IPwill Obe Osent. O

When Oset Oin Otext Oreceive Omode, Othe Omalware Ouses Othe OAdrGen Ofunction Oto Ocreate Oanother Oquery Ostring Owith Othe Or O(receiver) Oflag Oand Oa OW O(wait) Oaction Oparameter. O

The Oexpected OTXT Orecord Oresponse Ohas Othe Ofollowing Ostructure: Ocommand>data. O

In Oour Osample Otraffic, Othe OTXT Oresource Orecord Oreturned Ocontained: OS000s>10100. O

This Oresponse Otells Othe Omalware Oto Oset Oa Ovariable Ofor Othe Ofile Oname Oto Oreceivebox\rcvd10100 S-FILEand Oset Othe Onext Oquery Oaction Oto OD Oin Oorder Oto Orequest Othe Onext Ochunk Oof Odata. O

The Omalware Osends Oanother OTXT Oquery Owith Othe Oreceiver Ostructure. O

This Oquery Ois Odepicted Obelow: O39e9D60005eca60000BCC64T.sample-domain.evil S-FILEIn Othe Ocase Oof Oour Osample Otraffic, Othe Oserver Oresponded Owith Othe Ofollowing OTXT Oresource Orecord Odata: OS0000>d2hvYW1pJmlwY29uZmlnIC9hbGw=. O

The Ocontroller Oprovided Othe Omalware Owith Obase64-encoded S-ENCRdata Oto Obe Odecoded. O

The Odata Owill Oeventually Obe Owritten Oto Odisk Oand Othe Omalware Osets Othe Onext Oquery Oaction Oto OD Oin Oorder Oto Orequest Othe Onext Ochunk Oof Odata. O

The Odecoded Odata Oshows Oa Ocommand Oto Obe Oexecuted B-ACTwhoami&ipconfig I-ACT/all E-ACTon Othe Ovictim Osystem. O

The Omalware Osends Oanother OTXT Oquery Owith Othe Oreceiver Ostructure, Oas Odepicted Obelow. O

The OTXT Orecord Oreturned Ocontained Odata: OE0000>0 O. O

The Ocontroller Oissued Othe Ocommand Oto Owrite Othe Obase64-decoded Oand Omodified Odata Oto Othe Ofile Oname Oset Oearlier Oin Othe Oexchange O. O

After Othe Ofile Ois Owritten, Othe Omalware Omoves Oon Oto Oprocess Ooperations O. O

Glimpse S-MALcan Obe Oset Oto Ouse Oping Omode Oin Oseveral Oways Owhile Operforming Oreceive Ooperations O. O

If Oa Oquery Owith Othe OM Oaction Oreturns Oan OIP Oaddress Othat Ois Onot O99.250.250.199 S-IP, Othe Omalware Owill Ouse Oping Omode O. O

It Ois Oworth Onoting Othat Othe OIP Oresponse Oobserved Oto Oset Oping Omode Owas Othe Oreverse Oof Othe OIP Oused Oto Oset Otext Omode O(i.e., O199.250.250.99 S-IP) O. O

Ping Omode Owill Oalso Obe Oset Oif Oexceptions Ooccur Omore Othan Othree Otimes Oduring Otext Omode. O

In Othe Olatter Ocase, Othe OP Oaction Ois Opassed Oas Oone Oof Othe Oparameters Oto OAdrGen Oand Othe Oquery Ois Omade Ofor Oan OA Oresource Orecord Ousing Othe O[System.Net.Dns]::GetHostAddresses Omethod. O

If Operforming Oreceive Ooperations Oin Oping Omode, OGlimpse S-MALmakes Oa Oquery Owith Othe O0 Oaction Oto Ocontact Othe Ocontroller Ofor Otasking. O

This Oquery Ouses Oa Oreceive Ostructure Osimilar Oto Oan OM Oaction; Oit Ois Oworth Onoting Oall Oof Othe Oreceiver Ooperation Oqueries Omade Oin Oping Omode Ouse Othe O[System.Net.Dns]::GetHostAddresses Omethod. O

In Oour Osample, Oafter Othe Omalware Osent Othe O0 Oaction, Othe Ocontroller Oresponded Owith Oan OA Orecord Ocontaining O24.125.10.140 S-IP. O

This Oresponse Otells Othe Omalware Oto: OSet Othe Ofile Oname Ofor Othe Odata Othat Owill Ofollow Oto O10140, OSet Othe Opart Onumber Oto O0, OParse Oresponse Odata, OSet Oa O1 Oaction Ofor Othe Onext Oquery. O

O

In Othis Ocase, Othe Ocontent Onet Ouser Ois Owritten Oto Orcvd10140. O

After Owriting Othe Odata Oto Odisk, Oreceiver Ooperations Oare Ocomplete Oand Oprocessor Ooperations Obegin. O

After Owriting Othe Odata Oreceived Ofrom Othe Ocontroller, Oa Ofunction Ois Ocalled Oto Oprocess Othe Oreceived Ofile. O

The Oprocessor Ofunction Obuilds Oa Olist Oof Ofiles Ofrom Othe Ofiles Owith Ocontent Othat Omatch Orcvd* Oin Othe Oreceivebox Odirectory. O

Similar Oto OPoisonFrog S-MAL, Othe Olast Odigit Oof Othe Oreceived Ofile Oname Odetermines Ohow Othe Ocontent Oof Othe Ofile Ois Oprocessed. O

In Oour Osample Otraffic, Oafter Oexecuting Othe Ocommands Osent Ovia Ocmd.exe S-FILE, OGlimpse S-MALwrites Othe Ooutput Oof Othe Ocommands Oin Othe Osendbox Odirectory Oto Othe Oappropriate Ofile Onames O(e.g., O10100 Oor O10140) Oprepended Owith Oproc O(e.g., Oproc10100) O. O

Once Owritten, Othe Osend Ooperations Obegin. O

Similar Oto Otext Omode Oreceiver, Oafter OAdrGen S-MALbuilds Othe Ostring, Oa Ofunction Oto Omanually Obuild Oand Osend Othe ODNS PROTquery Opacket Ois Ocalled. O

The Otext Omode Osender Ouses Othe Osame Ohardcoded Otransaction OID O0xa4a3; Ohowever, Oinstead Oof Osending Oqueries Ofor OTXT Oresource Orecords, Othe Omalware Ouses OA Oresource Orecords. O

As Owith Othe Otext Omode Oreceiver, Othe Oquery Ois Omade Owith Oa Odirect Oconnection Oto Othe Ocontroller OIP Oaddress Oas Oopposed Oto Oallowing Othe Oquery Oto Opropagate Othe Onative ODNS PROTarchitecture. O

If Othe Osend Ofunction Ois Obeing Oinvoked Oin Oping Omode, Othe Oprocess Odescribed Oabove Ois Ofollowed; Ohowever, Oinstead Oof Omanually Obuilding Oand Otransmitting Othe ODNS PROTquery, Othe O[System.Net.Dns]::GetHostAddresses Omethod Ois Oused. O

With Othat Omethod, Othe Omalware’s Oquery Owill Otraverse Othe Onative ODNS PROTarchitecture Oas Oopposed Oto Othe Ovictim Omaking Oa Odirect Oconnection Oto Othe Ocontroller. O

The Osend Ofunction Ouses Oseveral Ocounters Oto Omaintain Ovarious Opieces Oof Oinformation Oused Oto Ocontrol Othe Oflow Oof Oexecution. O

An Oexception Ocounter Ois Oused Oto Otrack Othe Onumber Oof Oexceptions Oand Owill Oexit Othe Osend Oloop Oif Oa Othreshold Ois Ohit. O

The Osend Ocounter Ois Oused Oto Otrack Othe Onumber Oof Ochunks Osent Oto Othe Ocontroller. O

An Oadditional Ocounter Oexists Oto Ohandle Ocases Owhere Othe Ofile Obeing Osent Ois Olarger Othan O250 Ochunks. O

The Osend Ocounter Ois Oinitialized Oto O0 Oand Oread Ofrom Othe Ofourth Ooctet Oof Othe OA Orecord Oreturned Oby Othe Ocontroller. O

One Olayer Owill Odetect Oshellcode O, Oanother Ooptimizes Oit Ointo Oblocks O, Oanother Odetermines Oglobal Ovariables O, Oand Oso Oforth O. O

The Ooptinsn_t B-TOOL: I-TOOL:f I-TOOLunc E-TOOLcallback Ofunction Ois Ocalled Oin Omaturity Olevels Ofrom OMMAT_ZERO S-TOOL( Omicrocode Odoes Onot Oexist O) Oto OMMAT_GLBOPT2 S-TOOL( Omost Oglobal Ooptimizations Ocompleted O) O. O

During Othe Ocallback O, Oopaque Opredicates Opattern Omatching Ofunctions Oare Ocalled O. O

If Othe Ocode Opattern Ois Omatched Owith Othe Odefinitions O, Oit Ois Oreplaced Owith Oanother Oexpression Ofor Othe Odeobfuscation O. O

This Ois Oimportant Oto Operform Oin Oeach Omaturity Olevel Oas Othe Oobfuscated Ocode Ocould Obe Omodified Oor Oremoved Oas Othe Ocode Obecomes Omore Ooptimized O. O

We Odefined Otwo Opatterns Ofor Oanalysis Oof Othe OANEL S-MALsample O. O

The Oglobal Ovariable Ovalue Odword_745BB58C Ois Oeither Oeven Oor Oodd O, Oso Odword_745BB58C O* O( Odword_745BB58C O– O1 O) Ois Oalways Oeven O. O

This Oresults Oin Othe Olowest Obit Oof Othe Onegated Ovalue Obecoming O1 O. O

Thus O, OOR Oby O-2 O( O0xFFFFFFFE O) Owill Oalways Oproduce Othe Ovalue O-1 O. O

In Othis Ocase O, Othe Opattern Omatching Ofunction Oreplaces Odword_745BB58C O* O( Odword_745BB58C O– O1 O) Owith O2 O. O

The Oglobal Ovariable Ovalue Odword_72DBB588 Ois Oalways O0 Obecause Othe Ovalue Ois Onot Oinitialized O( Owe Ocan Ocheck Oit Oby Ois_loaded B-TOOLAPI E-TOOL) Oand Ohas Oonly Oread Oaccesses O. O

So Othe Opattern Omatching Ofunction Oreplaces Othe Oglobal Ovariable Owith O0 O. O

There Oare Osome Ovariants Owith Othis Opattern O( Oe.g O, Othe Ovariable O– O10 O< O0 O) O, Owhere Othe Oimmediate Oconstant Ocan Obe Odifferent O. O

We Oalso Oobserved Oa Opattern Othat Owas Oalso Ousing Oan O8-bit Oportion Oof Othe Oregister O. O

In Othe Ofollowing Oexample O, Othe Ovariable Ov5 Oin Opseudocode Ois Oa Oregister Ooperand O( Ocl O) Oin Omicrocode O. O

We Oneed Oto Ocheck Oif Othe Ovalue Ocomes Ofrom Othe Oresult Oof Ox O* O( Ox O– O1 O) O. O

In Oanother Oexample O, Othe Ovariable Ov2 Oin Opseudocode Ois Oa Oregister Ooperand O( Oecx O) Oin Omicrocode O. O

We Ohave Oto Ovalidate Oif Oa Oglobal Ovariable Owith Oabove-mentioned Oconditions Ois Oassigned Oto Othe Oregister O. O

Data-flow Otracking Ocode Owas Oadded Oto Odetect Othese Ouse-cases O. O

The Oadded Ocode Orequires Othat Othe Omblock_t S-TOOLpointer Oinformation Ois Opassed Ofrom Othe Oargument Oof Ooptinsn_t B-TOOL: I-TOOL:f I-TOOLunc E-TOOLto Otrace Oback Oprevious Oinstructions Ousing Othe Omblock_t S-TOOLlinked Olist O. O

However O, Othe Ocallback Oreturns ONULL Ofrom Othe Omblock_t S-TOOLpointer Oif Othe Oinstruction Ois Onot Oa Otop-level Oone O. O

If Othe Osetl Ois Oalways Osub-instruction Oduring Othe Ooptimization O, Owe Onever Oget Othe Opointer O. O

To Ohandle Othis Otype Oof Oscenario O, Othe Ocode Owas Omodified Oto Ocatch Oand Opass Othe Omblock_t S-TOOLof Othe Ojnz Oinstruction Oto Othe Osub-instruction O. O

The Ooriginal Oimplementation Ocalls Othe Ooptblock_t B-TOOL: I-TOOL:f I-TOOLunc E-TOOLcallback Ofunction Oin OMMAT_LOCOPT S-TOOL( Olocal Ooptimization Oand Ographing Oare Ocomplete O) Omaturity Olevel O. O

For Obrevity OI Owill Oquickly Ocover Osome Okey Opoints Oto Ounderstand Othe Oalgorithm Oat Oa Ohigh Olevel O. O

Normally Othe Ocall Oflow Ograph O( OCFG O) Oof Oa Ofunction Oobfuscated Owith Ocontrol Oflow Oflattening Ohas Oa Oloop Ostructure Ostarting Owith Oyellow-colored O“ Ocontrol Oflow Odispatcher O” Olike Othis O, Oshown Oafter Othe OFirst OBlock O. O

The Ooriginal Ocode Ois Oseparated Ointo Othe Oorange-colored O“ Ofirst Oblock O” Oand Ogreen-colored Oflattened Oblocks O. O

The Oanalyst Ois Othen Orequired Oto Oresolve Othe Ocorrect Onext Oblock Oand Omodify Othe Odestination Oaccordingly O. O

The Onext Oportion Oof Ofirst Oblock Oand Oeach Oflattened Oblock Ois Odecided Oby Oa O“ Oblock Ocomparison Ovariable O” Owith Oan Oimmediate Ovalue O. O

The Ovalue Oof Othe Ovariable Ois Oassigned Oto Oa Ospecific Oregister Oin Oeach Oblock Othen Ocompared Oin Oa Ocontrol Oflow Odispatcher Oand Oother Ocondition Oblocks O. O

If Othe Ovariable Oregisters Ofor Othe Ocomparison Oand Oassignment Oare Odifferent O, Othe Oassignment Ovariable Ois Ocalled O“ Oblock Oupdate Ovariable O” O( Owhich Ois Ofurther Oexplained Olater O) O. O

The Oalgorithm Olooks Ostraightforward Ohowever Osome Oportions Oof Othe Ocode Ohad Oto Obe Omodified Oin Oorder Oto Ocorrectly Odeobfuscate Othe Ocode O. O

This Ois Ofurther Odetailed Obelow O. O

As Opreviously Odetailed O, Othe Ooriginal Oimplementation Oof Othe Ocode Oonly Oworks Oin OMMAT_LOCOPT S-TOOLmaturity Olevel O. O

Rolles Osaid Othis Owas Oto Ohandle Oanother Oobfuscation Ocalled O“ OOdd OStack OManipulations O” O, Oreferred Oin Ohis Oblog O) O. O

However Othe Ounflattening Oof OANEL S-MALcode Ohad Oto Obe Operformed Oin Othe Olater Omaturity Olevel Osince Othe Oassignment Oof Oblock Ocomparison Ovariable Oheavily Odepends Oon Oopaque Opredicates O. O

As Oan Oexample Oin Othe Ofollowing Oobfuscated Ofunction O, Othe Ov3 Oand Ov7 Ovariables Oare Oassigned Oto Othe Oblock Ocomparison Ovariable O( Ob_cmp O) O. O

However Othe Ovalues Oare Odependent Oon Oopaque Opredicates Oresults O. O

Once Othe Oopaque Opredicates Oare Obroken O, Othe Oloop Ocode Obecomes Osimpler O. O

Unflattening Othe Ocode Oin Olater Omaturity Olevels Olike OMMAT_GLBOPT1 S-TOOLand OMMAT_GLBOPT2 S-TOOL( Ofirst Oand Osecond Opass Oof Oglobal Ooptimization O) Ocaused Oadditional Oproblems O. O

The Ounflattening Oalgorithm Orequires Omapping Oinformation Obetween Oblock Ocomparison Ovariable Oand Othe Oactual Oblock Onumber O( Omblock_t B-TOOL: I-TOOL:s I-TOOLerial E-TOOL) Oused Oin Othe Omicrocode O. O

In Olater Omaturity Olevels O, Osome Oblocks Oare Odeleted Oby Othe Ooptimization Oafter Odefeating Oopaque Opredicates O, Owhich Oremoves Othe Omapping Oinformation O. O

In Othe Oexample Obelow O, Othe Oblue-highlighted Oimmediate Ovalue O0x4624F47C Ois Oassigned Oto Oblock Ocomparison Ovariable Oin Othe Ofirst Oblock O. O

The Omapping Ocan Obe Ocreated Oby Ochecking Othe Oconditional Ojump Oinstruction O( Ojnz O) Oin OMMAT_LOCOPT S-TOOL. O

Additionally Ohere Ois Ono Omapping Oinformation Oin OMMAT_GLBOPT2 S-TOOLbecause Othe Ocondition Oblock Othat Ocontains Othe Ovariable Ohas Obeen Odeleted O. O

So Othe Onext Oblock Oof Othe Ofirst Oone Oin Othe Olevel Ocan Onot Obe Odetermined O. O

To Oresolve Othat Oissue O, Othe Ocode Owas Owritten Oto Olink Othe Oblock Ocomparison Ovariable Oand Oblock Oaddress Oin OMMAT_LOCOPT S-TOOL, Oas Othe Oblock Onumber Ois Ochanged Oin Oeach Omaturity Olevel O. O

If Othe Ocode Ocan’t Odetermine Othe Omapping Oin Olater Omaturity Olevels O, Oit Oattempts Oto Oguess Othe Onext Oblock Onumber Obased Oon Othe Oaddress O, Oconsidering Oeach Oblock Oand Oinstruction Oaddresses O. O

The Oguessing Ois Onot O100% Oaccurate Ohowever Oit Oworks Ofor Othe Omajority Oof Oobfuscated Ofunctions Otested O. O

Though Othe Ooriginal Oimplementation Oassumes Oan Oobfuscated Ofunction Ohas Oonly Oone Ocontrol Oflow Odispatcher O, Osome Ofunctions Oin Othe OANEL Osample Ohave Omultiple Ocontrol Odispatchers O. O

Originally Othe Ocode Ocalled Othe Ooptblock_t B-TOOL: I-TOOL:f I-TOOLunc E-TOOLcallback Oin OMMAT_GLBOPT1 S-TOOLand OMMAT_GLBOPT2 S-TOOL, Oas Othe Oresult Owas Onot Ocorrect Oin OMMAT_CALLS S-TOOL( Odetecting Ocall Oarguments O) O. O

However O, Othis Odid Onot Owork Ofor Ofunctions Owith Othree Oor Omore Odispatchers O. O

Additionally O, OHex-Rays S-TOOLkernel Odoesn’t Ooptimize Osome Ofunctions Oin OMMAT_GLBOPT2 S-TOOLif Oit Ojudges Othe Ooptimization Owithin Othe Olevel Ois Onot Orequired O. O

In Othis Ocase O, Othe Ocallback Ois Oexecuted Ojust Oonce Oin Othe Oimplementation O. O

To Ohandle Omultiple Ocontrol Oflow Odispatchers O, Oa Ocallback Ofor Odecompiler Oevents Owas Oimplemented O. O

The Ocode Ocatches Othe O“ Ohxe_prealloc O” Oevent O( Oaccording Oto OHex-Rays S-TOOL, Othis Ois Othe Ofinal Oevent Ofor Ooptimizations O) Othen Ocalls B-TOOLoptblock_t I-TOOL: I-TOOL:f I-TOOLunc E-TOOLcallback O. O

Typically Othis Oevent Ooccurs Oa Ofew Otimes Oto Oseveral Otimes O, Oso Othe Ocallback Ocan Odeobfuscate Omultiple Ocontrol Oflow Oflattenings O. O

Other Oadditional Omodifications Owere Omade Oto Othe Ocode O( Oe.g O, Owriting Oa Onew Oalgorithm Ofor Ofinding Ocontrol Oflow Odispatcher Oand Ofirst Oblock O, Ovalidating Oa Oblock Ocomparison Ovariable O, Oand Oso Oon O) O. O

After Othe Omodification O, Ofor Oexample O, Othe Ofollowing Ofunctions Owith Omultiple Ocontrol Oflow Odispatchers Ocan Obe Ounflattened O. O

The Ooriginal Oimplementation Osupports Othe Ofollowing Otwo Ocases Oof Oflattened Oblocks Oto Ofind Oa Oblock Ocomparison Ovariable Ofor Othe Onext Oblock O( Othe Ocases Oare Othen Osimplified O) O. O

In Othe Osecond Ocase O, Oblock Ocomparison Ovariable Ois Osearched Oin Oeach Oblock Oof OendsWithJcc S-TOOLand OnonJcc S-TOOL. O

If Othe Onext Oblock Ois Oresolved O, Othe OCFG O( Ospecifically Omblock_t B-TOOL: I-TOOL:p I-TOOLredset E-TOOLand Omblock_t B-TOOL: I-TOOL:s I-TOOLuccset E-TOOL) Oand Othe Odestination Oof Ogoto Ojump Oinstruction Oare Oupdated O. O

The Ocode Otracks Othe Oblock Ocomparison Ovariable Oin Oeach Opredecessor Oand Omore O( Oif Oany Oconditional Oblocks Obefore Othe Opredecessor O) Oto Oidentify Oeach Onext Oblock Ofor Ounflattening O. O

And O, Oin Othe Othird Ocase Othat Owas Oimplemented O, Othe Oblock Ocomparison Ovariables Oare Onot Oassigned Oin Othe Oflattened Oblocks Obut Orather Othe Ofirst Oblocks Oaccording Oto Oa Ocondition O. O

For Oexample O, Othe Ofollowing Omicrocode Ograph Oshows Oedi Ois Oassigned Oto Oesi O( Othe Oblock Ocomparison Ovariable Oin Othis Ocase O) Oin Oblock Onumber O7 Obut Othe Oedi Ovalue Ois Oassigned Oin Oblock Onumber O1 Oand O2 O. O

If Othe Oimmediate Ovalue Ofor Oblock Ocomparison Ovariable Ois Onot Ofound Oin Othe Oflattened Oblocks O, Othe Onew Ocode Otries Oto Otrace Othe Ofirst Oblocks Oto Oobtain Othe Ovalue Oand Oreconnects Oblock Onumber O1 Oand O2 Oas Osuccessors Oof Oblock Onumber O7 O, Oin Oaddition Oto Onormal Ooperations Omentioned Oin Othe Ooriginal Ocases O. O

In Othis Ocase O, Othe Ocode Oparses Othe Ostructure Oin Ofirst Oblocks Othen Oreconnects Oeach Oconditional Oblocks Ounder Othe Oflattened Oblocks O( O#1 Oand O#2 Oas Osuccessors Oof O#13 O, O#3 Oand O#4 Oas Osuccessors Oof O#11 O) O. O

Last O, Obut Onot Oleast O, Oin Oall Ocases Oexplained Ohere O, Othe Otail Oinstruction Oof Othe Odispatcher Opredecessor Ocan Obe Oa Oconditional Ojump Olike Ojnz O, Onot Ojust Ogoto O. O

The Omodified Ocode Ochecks Othe Otail Oinstruction Oand Oif Othe Otrue Ocase Odestination Ois Oa Ocontrol Oflow Odispatcher O, Oit Oupdates Othe OCFG Oand Othe Odestination Oof Othe Oinstruction O. O

The Ofollowing Ochanges Oare Ominor Ocompared Owith Oabove Oreferenced Oones O. O

The Ogoal Oof Othe Oattack Owas Oto Osurgically Otarget Oan Ounknown Opool Oof Ousers O, Owhich Owere Oidentified Oby Otheir Onetwork Oadapters’ OMAC Oaddresses O. O

The O
RAT S-TOOL
starts O

The O
first O
is O
responsible O
for O

the O
RAT S-TOOL

In O
fact O
, O
this O

one O
of O
the O
first O
checks O
it O
performs O

This O
RAT S-TOOL
uses O
three O

to O
perform O
all O
its O
command B-TOOL

. O

The O
first O
trick O
is O
the O
check O
of O

The O
actor O
used O
the O
same O
technique O
in O

in O
the O
JhoneRAT S-MAL

By O
default O
, O
most O
of O
the O
virtual O
machines O
do O
not O
have O
a O
serial O

on O
the O

. O

The O
attacker O
used O
a O
second O
trick O
to O
avoid O
analysis O
of O
the O
python S-TOOL

. O

The O
actor O
used O
the O
same O
trick O
that O

Based O
on O

the O

the O
correct O
interpretation O
is O
the O
first O
one O
based O
on O
the O

. O

For O
this O

it O
is O

because O
it O

the O

Additionally O
the O

For O
example O

the O

This O

The O

of O
the O

as O

an O
Arabic-speaking O

group O
called O

. O

This O
group O
has O
been O
operating O
in O

Similar O
to O
previous O
attacks O
, O
this O
campaign O
starts O
with O
social O

. O

In O
one O
instance O
, O
it O
lures O
victims O
to O
open O
an O
email S-TOOL
attachment O

In O
others O
, O
it O
persuades O

to O
download O
a O

about O
a O
recent O
political O
affair O
pertaining O
to O
the O
Middle B-LOC

specifically O
to O

In O
most O

the O

the O

double-clicks O

some O

the O
past O
few O
months O
, O
was O
simply O
developing O
their O
toolkit O
for O
illicit O
income O
sources O
. O

While O
they O
have O
been O
quiet O
since O
our O
June O
analysis O
, O
we O
observed O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
group O
’s O
activities O
in O
December S-TIME
, O
with O
updates O
on O
the O
kits O
’ O
capabilities O
reminiscent O
of O
their O
previous O
attacks O
. O

The O
updates O
expanded O
scanner O
parameters O
and O
targets O
, O
looped O
execution O
of O
files O
via O
error O
messages O
, O
improved O
evasion O
techniques O
for O
scanning O
activities O
, O
and O
improved O
mining O
profits O
by O
killing O
off O
both O
the O
competition O
and O
their O
own O
previous O
miners O
. O

We O
analyzed O
the O
kits O
, O
which O
were O
designed O
to O
steal O
information O
from O
the O
automotive O
and O
finance O
industries O
, O
launch O
subsequent O
attacks O
on O
already O
compromised O
systems O
, O
and O
( O
possibly O
) O
sell O
stolen O
information O
. O

Comparing O
this O
development O
to O
their O
previous O
attacks O
, O
we O
think O
Outlaw S-APT
may O
be O
aiming O
to O
go O
after O
enterprises O
that O
have O
yet O
to O
update O
their O
systems O
, O
assessing O
security O
and O
changes O
with O
their O
previously O
infected O
hosts O
, O
finding O
new O
and O
old O
targets O
, O
and O
possibly O
testing O
their O
updates O
in O
the O
wild O
. O

We O
will O
continue O
to O
observe O
the O
group O
’s O
activities O
as O
they O
target O
industries O
from O
the B-LOC
United I-LOC
States E-LOC
and O
Europe S-LOC
. O

Based O
on O
the O
samples O
we O
collected O
and O
traced O
to O
456 O
distinct O
IPs O
, O
we O
expect O
the O
group O
to O
be O
more O
active O
in O
the O
coming O
months O
as O
we O
observed O
changes O
on O
the O
versions O
we O
acquired O
. O

These O
new O
samples O
targeted O
Linux- S-OS
and O
Unix-based B-OS
operating I-OS
systems E-OS
, O
vulnerable O
servers O
, O
and O
internet O
of O

by O
exploiting O
known O

with O
available O

. O

This O
time O
, O
the O
group O
explored O
unpatched O
systems O
vulnerable O
to O
CVE-2016-8655 S-VULID
and O
Dirty B-VULNAME
COW E-VULNAME
exploit O
( O
CVE-2016-5195 S-VULID
) O
as O

. O

Files O
using O
simple O
PHP-based O
web O

were O
also O
used O
to O
attack O
systems O
with O
weak O
SSH S-PROT
and O
Telnet S-PROT
credentials O
. O

While O
no O
phishing- O
or O
social O
engineering-initiated O
routines O
were O
observed O
in O
this O
campaign O
, O
we O
found O
multiple O
attacks O
over O
the O
network O
that O
are O
considered O
“ O
loud. O


” O
These O
involved O
large-scale O
scanning O
operations O
of O
IP O
ranges O
intentionally O
launched O
from O
the O
command B-TOOL
and I-TOOL
control E-TOOL
( O
C&C O
) O
server O
. O

The O
honeynet O
graphs O
, O
which O
show O
activity O
peaks O
associated O
with O
specific O
actions O
, O
also O
suggest O
that O
the O
scans O
were O
timed O
. O

We O
also O
considered O
the O
move O
as O
an O
obfuscation O
technique O
, O
as O
it O
was O
mixed O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
script O
kiddie O
activities O
that O
can O
easily O
be O
mistaken O
for O
grey O
noise O
online O
. O

The O
attackers O
could O
hide O
their O
activities O
if O
they O
noted O
the O
business O
hours O
of O
the O
intended O
targets O
and O
performed O
the O
actions O
coinciding O
with O
said O
times O
. O

From O
the O
sample O
we O
analyzed O
, O
attacks O
started O
from O
one O
virtual B-TOOL
private I-TOOL
server E-TOOL
( O
VPS S-TOOL
) O
that O
searches O
for O
a O

( O
previous O

) O
. O

Once O
infected O
, O
the O
C&C S-TOOL
commands O
for O
the O
infected O
system O
launches O
a O
loud O
scanning O
activity O
and O
spreads O
the O
botnet O
by O
sending O
a O
“ O

” O
of O

at O
once O
with O
naming O

likely O
banking O

” O
They O
attempted O
to O
evade O
traffic O
inspection O
by O
encoding O
the O

for O
the O

The O

another O

from O
previous O

but O
updated O
with O
a O
larger O
set O
of O
parameters O
and O
programmed O
to O
run O
in O
the O
background O
. O

The O
kit O
we O
found O
is O
in O
tgz O

, O
though O
we O
have O
observed O
some O
samples O
disguised O
as O

. O

While O
previous O
routines O
took O
advantage O
of O
competing O
miners O
’ O
activities O
and O
unrelated O
components O
to O
hijack O
the O

, O
the O

, O
as O

as O
those O
from O

to O
maximize O
the O

and O
creates O
a O
new O

and O
extract O
the O

The O

binary O
then O
runs O
in O
the O

, O
forwarding O
a O
series O
of O

ensuring O
the O

The O

Another O

executes O
a O

once O
a O

Most O
of O
these O

are O

In O
a O
previous O

( O
published O
in O
June B-TIME

) O
, O
we O
observed O
that O

it O
was O
hardly O
executed O
, O
indicating O
that O
this O

Running O
the O

removes O
the O
remaining O

, O
keeping O
a O

If O
the O

has O
been O
previously O
infected O
with O
a O
cryptominer O
, O
it O
also O
attempts O

. O

Based O
on O
a O

we O
found O

there O
are O
other O

Both O

that O
all O

We O
also O
found O
the O
init0 S-FILE
script O
running O

the O
script O
cleans O
out O
all O

It O
then O
resets O

The O

installation O
of O
a O
Shellbot S-MAL
to O
gain O

The O
Shellbot S-MAL
disguises O
itself O
as O
a O

commonly O
the O

on O
many O
Unix- S-OS
and O
Linux-based B-OS
systems E-OS
to O
automatically O
run O
for O

. O

This O
allows O
the O
malicious O
activity O
to O
evade O
detection O
. O

The O
Shellbot S-MAL

is O
added O
to O
run O
after O
the O

the O

It O
remains O

whether O
these O
are O
leftover O

from O
the O
previous O

or O
their O
particular O
purposes O
were O
served O
. O

Shellbot S-MAL
is O
also O
used O
to O
control O
the O

with O
a O

All O

Since O
discovering O
the O
operations O
of O
this O
group O
in O
2018 S-TIME
, O
Outlaw S-APT
continues O
to O
use O
scripts O
, O
codes O
, O
and O
commands O
that O
have O
been O
previously O
used O

These O
routines O
are O
indicative O
of O
the O
group O
’s O
aim O
to O
get O
quantitative O
returns O
through O
varied O
cybercriminal O
profit O
streams O
. O

This O
was O
also O
reinforced O
by O
their O
naming O
conventions O
, O
wherein O
different O

are O
simply O
named O
after O
the O

, O
following O
a O

Furthermore O
, O
based O
on O
the O
group O

use O

as O
vectors O
that O
companies O
would O
have O
likely O
addressed O

, O
it O
appears O
that O
they O
’re O
going O
after O
enterprises O
who O
have O
yet O
to O
patch O
their O

, O
as O
well O
as O
companies O
with O
internet-facing O

with O
weak O

Considering O
the O
amount O
of O

needed O
to O
deploy O
all O
the O
necessary O
patches O
for O
an O
enterprise O
( O
such O
as O

, O
which O
implies O
costly O
downtime O
for O
operations O
and O
the O
hesitation O
to O
update O
all O

immediately O
, O
Outlaw S-APT
may O
find O
even O
more O

Save O

, O
combinations O
from O
previous O
deployments O
, O
and O
using O
the O
routines O
repetitively O
for O
every O
campaign O
, O
we O
found O
very O
little O
changes O
in O
the O
group O
’s O
toolkit O
, O
which O
allowed O
various O
honeypots S-MAL
across O
the O
Eastern B-LOC

region O
to O
detect O
many O
of O
the O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
group O
uses O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
IP O
addresses O
as O
input O
for O
scanning O

that O
are O
grouped O
by O

attack O
certain O
regions O
or O

within O
particular O
periods O
of O
the O

, O
as O
previously O
observed O
. O

We O
think O
the O
group O
has O
likely O
become O
more O
enterprising O
, O
and O
learned O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
some O

while O
exerting O
minimal O

By O
shaping O
the O

the O

may O
be O
able O
to O
create O
niches O
in O
the O
underground O
, O
catering O
to O
the O
specific O

they O
can O
avoid O

as O
they O
avoid O

them O
. O

Collection O
of O

from O

this O
manner O
might O
be O
easier O
to O
sort O
( O

, O
as O

Winnti B-APT
Group E-APT
targeting O
universities O
in O
Hong B-LOC

. O

In O
November B-TIME
2019 E-TIME
, O
we O
discovered O
a O
new O
campaign O
run O
by O
the O
Winnti B-APT
Group E-APT
against O
two O
Hong B-LOC
Kong E-LOC
universities O
. O

We O
found O
a O
new O
variant O
of O
the O
ShadowPad B-MAL
backdoor E-MAL
, O
the O
group O
’s O
flagship O
backdoor S-MAL
, O
deployed O
using O
a O
new O
launcher O
and O
embedding O
numerous O

. O

The B-MAL
Winnti I-MAL
malware E-MAL
was O
also O
found O
at O
these O
universities O
a O
few O
weeks O
prior O
to O
ShadowPad S-MAL
. O

The O
Winnti B-APT
Group E-APT
, O
active O
since O
at B-TIME
least I-TIME
2012 E-TIME
, O
is O
responsible O
for O
for O
high-profile O
supply-chain O
attacks O
against O
the O
video O
game O
and O

industries O
leading O
to O
the O

software E-MAL
( O
such O
as O
CCleaner S-TOOL

) O
that O
is O
then O
used O

It O
is O
also O
known O
for O
having O
compromised O
various O

documenting O
a O

Additionally O
, O
we O
published O

of O
this O

About O
the O
“ O
Winnti B-APT
Group E-APT
” O
naming O
: OWe O
have O
chosen O
to O
keep O
the O
name O
“ O
Winnti B-APT
Group E-APT
” O
since O
it O
’s O
the O
name O
first O
used O
to O
identify O
it O
, O
in O
2013 S-TIME
, O
by O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
. O

Since O
Winnti S-MAL
is O
also O
a O
malware O
family O
, O
we O
always O
write O
“ O
Winnti B-APT
Group E-APT
” O
when O
we O
refer O
to O
the O
malefactors O
behind O
the O
attacks O
. O

Since O
2013 S-TIME
, O
it O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
Winnti S-MAL
is O
only O
one O
of O
the O
many O
malware O
families O
used O
by O
the O
Winnti B-APT
Group E-APT
. O

In O
November B-TIME
2019 E-TIME
, O
ESET S-IDTY
’s O
machine-learning O
engine O
, O
Augur S-TOOL
, O
detected O
a O
malicious O
and O
unique O
sample O
present O
on O
multiple O
computers O
belonging O
to O
two O
Hong B-LOC
Kong E-LOC
universities O
where O
the O
Winnti S-MAL
malware O
had O
already O
been O
found O
at O
the O
end B-TIME
of I-TIME
October E-TIME
. O

The O
suspicious O
sample O
detected O
by O
Augur S-TOOL
is O
actually O
a O
new O
32-bit O
ShadowPad S-MAL
launcher O
. O

Samples O
from O
both O
ShadowPad S-MAL
and O
Winnti S-MAL
found O
at O
these O
universities O
contain O
campaign O

and O
C&C S-TOOL
URLs O
with O
the O
names O
of O
the O
universities O
, O
which O
indicates O
a O

. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
two O
compromised O
universities O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
C&C S-TOOL
URL O
format O
used O
by O
the O
attackers O
we O
have O
reasons O
to O
think O
that O
at O
least O
three O
additional O
Hong B-LOC
Kong E-LOC
universities O
may O
have O
been O
compromised O
using O
these O
same O
ShadowPad S-MAL
and O
Winnti S-MAL
variants O
. O

This O
campaign O
of O
the O
Winnti B-APT
Group E-APT
against O
Hong B-LOC
Kong E-LOC
universities O
was O
taking O
place O
in O
the O
context O
of O
Hong B-LOC
Kong E-LOC
facing O
civic O
protests O
that O
started O
in O
June B-TIME
2019 E-TIME
triggered O
by O
an O
extradition O
bill O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
bill O
was O
withdrawn O
in O
October B-TIME
2019 E-TIME
, O
protests O
continued O
, O
demanding O
full O
democracy O
and O
investigation O
of O
the O
Hong B-LOC
Kong E-LOC
police O
. O

These O
protests O
gathered O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
people O
in O
the O
streets O
with O
large O
support O
from O
students O
of O
Hong B-LOC
Kong E-LOC
universities O
, O
leading O
to O
multiple O
university O
campus O
occupations O
by O
the O
protesters O
. O

We O
have O
contacted O
the O
compromised O
universities O
and O
provided O
the O
necessary O
information O
and O
assistance O
to O
remediate O
the O
compromise O
. O

Unlike O
previous O
ShadowPad S-MAL
variants O
documented O
in O
our O
white O
paper O
on O
the O
arsenal O
of O
the O
Winnti B-APT
Group E-APT
, O
this O
launcher O
is O
not O
obfuscated O
using O
VMProtect S-TOOL
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
encrypted O
payload O
is O
neither O
embedded O
in O
the O
overlay O
nor O
located O
in O
a O
COM1:NULL.dat O
alternate O
data O
stream O
. O

And O
the O
usual O
RC5 S-ENCR
encryption O
with O
a O
key O
derived O
from O
the O
volume O
ID O
of O
the O
system O
drive O
of O
the O
victim O
machine O
( O
as O
seen O
in O
the O
PortReuse B-MAL
backdoor E-MAL
, O
skip-2.0 S-MAL
and O
some O
ShadowPad S-MAL
variants O
) O
is O
not O
present O
either O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
launcher O
is O
much O
simpler O
. O

The O
launcher O
is O
a O
32-bit O
DLL S-TOOL
named O
hpqhvsei.dll S-FILE
, O
which O
is O
the O
name O
of O
a O
legitimate O
DLL S-TOOL
loaded O
by O
hpqhvind.exe S-FILE
. O

This O
executable O
is O
from O
HP S-IDTY
and O
is O
usually O
installed O
with O
their O
printing O
and O
scanning O
software O
called O
“ O
HP B-TOOL
Digital I-TOOL
Imaging E-TOOL
” O
. O

In O
this O
case O
the O
legitimate O
hpqhvind.exe S-FILE
was O
dropped O
by O
the O
attackers O
, O
along O
with O
their O
malicious O
hpqhvsei.dll S-FILE
, O
in O
C:\Windows\Temp O
. O

Although O
we O
do O
not O
have O
the O
component O
that O
dropped O
and O
executed O
this O
launcher O
, O
the O
presence O
of O
these O
files O
leads O
us O
to O
think O
that O
the O
initial O
execution O
of O
this O
launcher O
is O
done O
through O
DLL B-TOOL
side-l S-TOOLoading E-TOOL
. O

When O
the O
malicious O
DLL S-TOOL
is O
loaded O
at O
hpqhvind.exe S-FILE
startup O
, O
its O
DLLMain O
function O
is O
called O
that O
will O
check O
its O
parent O
process O
for O
the O
following O
sequence O
of O
bytes O
at O
offset O
0x10BA O
. O

In O
the O
case O
where O
the O
parent O
process O
is O
hpqhvind.exe S-FILE
, O
this O
sequence O
of O
bytes O
is O
present O
at O
this O
exact O
location O
and O
the O
malicious O
DLL S-TOOL
will O
proceed O
to O
patch O
the O
parent O
process O
in O
memory O
. O

It O
replaces O
the O
original O
instructions O
at O
0x10BA O
with O
an O
unconditional O
jump O
( O
jmp O
– O
0xE9 O
) O
to O
the O
address O
of O
the O
function O
from O
hpqhvsei.dll S-FILE
that O
decrypts O
and O
executes O
the O
encrypted O
payload O
embedded O
in O
the O
launcher O
. O

The O
decompiled O
function O
responsible O
for O
patching O
the O
parent O
process O
. O

In O
case O
hpqhvsei.dll S-FILE
is O
loaded O
by O
a O
different O
process O
than O
hpqhvind.exe S-FILE
, O
the O
malicious O
code O
will O
not O
be O
decrypted O
and O
executed O
. O

The O
difference O
between O
the O
original O
and O
patched O
hpqhvind.exe S-FILE
. O

The O
part O
of O
the O
code O
that O
is O
patched O
is O
located O
at O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
the O
main O
function O
of O
hpqhvind.exe S-FILE
. O

The O
patched O
code O
is O
located O
right O
after O
the O
load O
of O
hpqhvsei.dll S-FILE
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
function O
responsible O
for O
decrypting O
and O
executing O
the O
payload O
is O
executed O
directly O
after O
the O
load O
of O
the O
malicious O
DLL S-TOOL
. O

The O
encrypted O
payload O
is O
located O
in O
the O
.rdata O
section O
of O
hpqhvsei.dll S-FILE
and O
the O
decryption O
algorithm O
is O
an O
XOR S-ENCR
loop O
where O
the O
XOR S-ENCR
key O
is O
updated O
at O
each O
iteration O
. O

The O
decrypted O
payload O
is O
the O
usual O
shellcode S-TOOL
responsible O
for O
ShadowPad S-MAL
initialization O
( O
obfuscated O
using O
fake O
conditional O
jumps O
to O
hinder O
disassembly O
) O
. O

After O
having O
been O
decrypted O
, O
ShadowPad S-MAL
’s O
shellcode S-TOOL
is O
executed O
. O

It O
will O
first O
achieve O
persistence O
on O
the O
system O
by O
writing O
the O
in-memory O
patched O
parent O
process O
to O
disk O
to O
a O
path O
specified O
in O
the O
configuration O
string O
pool O
. O

In O
the O
case O
we O
examined O
, O
the O
path O
was O
C:\ProgramData\DRM\CLR\CLR.exe S-FILE
. O

It O
then O
creates O
a O
service O
named O
clr_optimization_v4.0.30229_32 O
, O
which O
is O
responsible O
for O
executing O
CLR.exe S-FILE
. O

To O
avoid O
suspicion O
, O
this O
service O
name O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
executable O
name O
, O
were O
chosen O
to O
look O
similar O
to O
the O
name O
of O
a O
Microsoft B-TOOL

The O
numbering O
on O
each O
arrow O
corresponds O
to O
the O
chronological O
sequence O
of O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
variants O
we O
described O
in O
our O
white O
paper O
did O
n’t O
even O
have O
that O

embedded O
. O

As O
with O
previous O
ShadowPad S-MAL
variants O
, O
the O
Config O
module O
( O
102 O
) O
contains O
an O
encrypted O
string O
pool O
that O
can O
be O
accessed O
from O
any O
other O
module O
. O

The O
string O
pool O
is O
never O
stored O
entirely O
decrypted O
in O
memory O
; O
the O
field O
of O
interest O
is O
decrypted O
when O
needed O
and O
then O
immediately O
freed O
( O
thus O
quickly O
unavailable O
) O
. O

The O
configuration O
size O
is O
2180 O
bytes O
and O
the O
encrypted O
strings O
are O
located O
at O
offset O
0x84 O
. O

The O
algorithm O
used O
to O
decrypt O
the O
strings O
is O
the O
same O
as O
the O
one O
used O
to O
decrypt O
the O
static O
strings O
of O
the O
module O
. O

The O
campaign O
ID O
is O
located O
at O
offset O
0x99 O
and O
is O
the O
name O
of O
the O
targeted O
university O
. O

Having O
a O
campaign O
ID O
related O
to O
the O
target O
is O
quite O
common O
in O
the O
case O
of O
ShadowPad S-MAL
and O
Winnti S-MAL
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
timestamp O
present O
in O
this O
config O
at O
offset O
0x84 O
is O
later O
than O
the O
modules O
’ O
timestamps O
and O
the O
loader O
compilation O
timestamp O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
this O
config O
is O
added O
manually O
to O
the O
sample O
after O
having O
been O
built O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
’s O
probably O
coincidental O
, O
the O
date O
within O
the O
config O
corresponds O
to O
the O
date O
of O
the O
first O
detection O
of O
this O
sample O
at O
the O
corresponding O
university O
. O

Once O
installed O
on O
the O
system O
, O
ShadowPad S-MAL
starts O
a O

wmplayer.exe S-FILE
process O
and O
injects O
itself O
into O
that O
process O
. O

The O
path O
to O
wmplayer.exe S-FILE
is O
provided O
by O
the O
Config O
module O
. O

Once O
ShadowPad S-MAL
is O
injected O
into O
wmplayer.exe S-FILE
, O
the O
Online O
module O
will O
contact O
the O
C&C S-TOOL
server O
using O
the O

specified O
in O
the O

. O

The O
communication O
is O
then O
handled O
by O
the O
TCP S-PROT
module O
( O
200 O
) O
, O
which O
was O
previously O
documented O
by O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
. O

In O
addition O
to O
ShadowPad S-MAL
, O
the O
Winnti S-MAL

was O
found O
on O
some O

at O
these O

and O
is O
detected O
by O
ESET S-IDTY
products O
as O

. O

The O
Winnti S-MAL
malware O
usually O
contains O
a O
configuration O
specifying O
a O
campaign O
ID O
and O
a O
C&C S-TOOL
URL O
. O

On O
all O

the O
campaign O

matches O
the O

where O
the O

One O

observe O
that O
the O

both O
Winnti S-MAL

These O
2 O

in O
the O

Insights O
from O
one O
year O
of O
tracking O
a O
polymorphic O
threat O
. O

A O
little O
over O
a O
year O
ago O
, O
in O
October B-TIME
2018 E-TIME
, O
our O
polymorphic O
outbreak O
monitoring O
system O
detected O
a O
large O
surge O
in O
reports O
, O
indicating O
that O
a O
large-scale O
campaign O
was O
unfolding O
. O

We O
observed O
as O
the O
new O
threat O
attempted O
to O
deploy O
files O
that O
changed O
every O
20-30 O
minutes O
on O
thousands O
of O
devices O
. O

We O
gave O
the O
threat O
the O
name O
“ O
Dexphot S-MAL
, O
” O
based O
on O
certain O
characteristics O
of O
the O
malware O
code O
. O

The O
Dexphot S-MAL
attack O
used O
a O
variety O
of O
sophisticated O
methods O
to O
evade O
security O
solutions O
. O

Layers O
of O
obfuscation O
, O
encryption O
, O
and O
the O
use O
of O
randomized O
file O
names O
hid O
the O
installation O
process O
. O

Dexphot S-MAL
then O
used O
fileless O
techniques O
to O
run O
malicious O
code O
directly O
in O
memory O
, O
leaving O
only O
a O
few O
traces O
that O
can O
be O
used O
for O
forensics O
. O

It O
hijacked O
legitimate O
system O
processes O
to O
disguise O
malicious O
activity O
. O

If O
not O
stopped O
, O
Dexphot S-MAL
ultimately O
ran B-ACT
a I-ACT
cryptocurrency I-ACT
miner I-ACT
on I-ACT
the I-ACT
device E-ACT
, O
with O
monitoring O
services O
and O
scheduled O
tasks O
triggering O
re-infection O
when O
defenders O
attempt O
to O
remove O
the O
malware O
. O

In O
the O
months O
that O
followed O
, O
we O
closely O
tracked O
the O
threat O
and O
witnessed O
the O
attackers O
upgrade O
the O
malware O
, O
target O
new O
processes O
, O
and O
work O
around O
defensive O
measures O
. O

While O

blocked O
Dexphot S-MAL

, O

provided O
protection O
for O
cases O
where O
the O

’s O
persistence O
mechanisms O
, O
polymorphism O
, O
and O
use O
of O
fileless O
techniques O
, O
behavior-based O
detection O
was O
a O
critical O
component O
of O
the O
comprehensive O
protection O
against O
this O
malware O
and O
other O
threats O
that O
exhibit O
similar O
malicious O

shows O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
behavioral O

in O

the O
Dexphot S-MAL
campaign O
. O

Over O
time O
, O
Dexphot-related O
malicious O
behavior O
reports O
dropped O
to O
a O
low O
hum O
, O
as O
the O
threat O
lost O
steam O
. O

Our O
close O
monitoring O
of O
Dexphot S-MAL
helped O
us O
ensure O
that O
our O
customers O
were O
protected O
from O
the O
evolving O
threat O
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
one O
year O
’s O
worth O
of O
intelligence O
helped O
us O
gain O
insight O
not O
only O
into O
the O
goals O
and O
motivations O
of O
Dexphot S-MAL
’s O
authors O
, O
but O
of O
cybercriminals O
in O
general O
. O

The O
early O
stages O
of O
a O
Dexphot S-MAL
infection O
involves O
numerous O
files O
and O
processes O
. O

During O
the O
execution O
stage O
, O
Dexphot O
writes O
five O
key O
files O
to O
disk O
: O1 O
、An O
installer O
with O
two O
URLs O
; O2 O
、An O
MSI S-TOOL
package O
file O
downloaded O
from O
one O
of O
the O
URLs O
; O3 O
、A O
password-protected O
ZIP O
archive O
; O4 O
、A O
loader O
DLL S-TOOL
, O
which O
is O
extracted O
from O
the O
archive O
; O5 O
、An O
encrypted O
data O
file O
that O
holds O
three O
additional O
executables O
that O
are O
loaded O
into O
system O
processes O
via O
process O
hollowing O
. O

Except O
for O
the O
installer O
, O
the O
other O
processes O
that O
run O
during O
execution O
are O
legitimate O
system O
processes O
. O

This O
can O
make O
detection O
and O
remediation O
more O
difficult O
. O

These O
legitimate O
system O
processes O
include O
msiexec.exe S-FILE
( O
for O
installing O
MSI S-TOOL
packages O
) O
, O
unzIP S-TOOL
. O

exe S-FILE
( O
for O
extracting O

from O
the O
password-protected O

) O
, O
rundll32.exe S-FILE
( O

, O
schtasks.exe S-FILE
( O
for O
scheduled O
tasks O
) O
, O
powershell.exe S-FILE
( O
for O
forced O

) O
. O

In O
later O
stages O
, O
Dexphot S-MAL
targets O
a O
few O
other O
system O
processes O
for O
process O
hollowing O
: O
svchost.exe S-FILE
, O
tracert.exe S-FILE
, O
and O
setup.exe S-FILE
. O

Based O
on O
Microsoft B-TOOL
Defender E-TOOL
ATP O
signals O
, O
SoftwareBundler B-MAL
: I-MAL
Win32/ICLoader E-MAL
and O
its O
variants O
are O
primarily O
used O
to O
drop O
and O
run O
the O
Dexphot B-MAL S-MAL I-MAL
installer E-MAL
. O

The O
installer O
uses O
two O
URLs O
to O
download O
malicious O
payloads O
. O

These O
are O
the O
same O
two O
URLs O
that O
Dexphot S-MAL
use O
later O
to O
establish O
persistence O
, O
update O
the O
malware O
, O
and O
re-infect O
the O
device O
. O

The O
installer O
downloads O
an O
MSI S-TOOL
package O
from O
one O
of O
the O
two O
URLs O
, O
and O
then O
launches O
msiexec.exe S-FILE
to O
perform O
a O
silent O
install O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
of O
several O
instances O
of O
Dexphot S-MAL
employing O
living-off-the-land O
techniques O
, O
the O
use O
of O
legitimate O
system O
processes O
for O
nefarious O
purposes O
. O

Dexphot S-MAL
’s O
package O
often O
contains O
an O
obfuscated O
batch O
script O
. O

If O
the O
package O
contains O
this O
file O
, O
the O
script O
is O
the O
first O
thing O
that O
msiexec.exe S-FILE
runs O
when O
it O
begins O
the O
installation O
process O
. O

The O
said O
obfuscated O
script O
is O
designed O
to O
check O
for O
antivirus O
products O
. O

Dexphot S-MAL
halts O
the O
infection O
process O
immediately O
if O
an O
antivirus O
product O
is O
found O
running O
. O

When O
we O
first O
began O
our O
research O
, O
the O
batch O
script O
only O
checked O
for O
antivirus O
products O
from O
Avast S-TOOL
and O
AVG S-TOOL
. O

Later O
, O
Windows B-TOOL
Defender I-TOOL
Antivirus E-TOOL
was O
added O
to O
the O
checklist O
. O

If O
the O
process O
is O
not O
halted O
, O
Dexphot S-MAL
decompresses O
the O
password-protected O
ZIP O
archive O
from O
the O
MSI S-TOOL
package O
. O

The O
password O
to O
this O
archive O
is O
within O
the O
MSI S-TOOL
package O
. O

Along O
with O
the O
password O
, O
the O
malware O
’s O
authors O
also O
include O
a O
clean O
version O
of O
unzIP S-TOOL
. O

exe S-FILE
so O
that O
they O
do O
n’t O
have O
to O
rely O
on O
the O
target O
system O
having O
a O
ZIP B-TOOL
utility E-TOOL
. O

The O
unzIP S-TOOL
. O

exe S-FILE
file O
in O
the O
package O
is O
usually O
named O
various O
things O
, O
such O
as O
z.exe S-FILE
or O
ex.exe S-FILE
, O
to O
avoid O
scrutiny O
. O

The O
ZIP O
archive O
usually O
contains O
three O
files O
: O
the B-TOOL
loader I-TOOL
DLL E-TOOL
, O
an O
encrypted O
data O
file O
( O
usually O
named O
bin.dat S-FILE
) O
, O
and O
, O
often O
, O
one O
clean B-TOOL
unrelated I-TOOL
DLL E-TOOL
, O
which O
is O
likely O
included O
to O
mislead O
detection O
. O

Dexphot S-MAL
usually O
extracts O
the O
decompressed O
files O
to O
the O
target O
system O
’s O
Favorites B-TOOL
folder E-TOOL
. O

The O
files O
are O
given O
new O
, O
random O
names O
, O
which O
are O
generated O
by O
concatenating O
words O
and O
numbers O
based O
on O
the O
time O
of O
execution O
( O
for O
example O
, O
C:\Users\<user>\Favorites\\Res.Center.ponse\<numbers> O
) O
. O

Msiexec.exe S-FILE
next O
calls O
rundll32.exe S-FILE
, O
specifying O
loader B-TOOL
DLL E-TOOL S-TOOL
( O
urlmon.7z S-FILE
in O
the O
example O
above O
) O
in O
order O
to O
decrypt B-MAL
the I-MAL
data I-MAL
file E-MAL
. O

The O
decryption O
process O
involves O
ADD S-ENCR
and O
XOR S-ENCR
operations O
, O
using O
a O
key O
hardcoded O
in O
the O
binary O
. O

The O
decrypted O
data O
contains O
three O
executables O
. O

Unlike O
the O
files O
described O
earlier O
, O
these O
executables O
are O
never O
written O
to O
the O
filesystem O
. O

Instead O
, O
they O
exist O
only O
in O
memory O
, O
and O
Dexphot S-MAL
runs O
them O
by O
loading O
them O
into O
other O
system O
processes O
via O
process B-TOOL
hollowing E-TOOL
. O

Process B-TOOL
hollowing E-TOOL
is O
a O
technique O
that O
can O
hide O
malware O
within O
a O
legitimate O
system O
process O
. O

It O
replaces O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
legitimate O
process O
with O
malicious O
code O
. O

Detecting O
malicious O
code O
hidden O
using O
this O
method O
is O
not O
trivial O
, O
so O
process B-TOOL
hollowing E-TOOL
has O
become O
a O
prevalent O
technique O
used O
by O
malware O
today O
. O

This O
method O
has O
the O
additional O
benefit O
of O
being O
fileless O
: O
the O
code O
can O
be O
run O
without O
actually O
being O
saved O
on O
the O
file O
system O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
harder O
to O
detect O
the O
malicious O
code O
while O
it O
’s O
running O
, O
it O
’s O
harder O
to O
find O
useful O
forensics O
after O
the O
process O
has O
stopped O
. O

To O
initiate O
process B-TOOL
hollowing E-TOOL
, O
the B-TOOL
loader I-TOOL
DLL E-TOOL S-TOOL
targets O
two O
legitimate O
system O
processes O
, O
for O
example O
svchost.exe S-FILE
or O
nslookup.exe S-FILE
, O
and O
spawns O
them O
in O
a O
suspended O
state O
. O

The B-TOOL
loader I-TOOL
DLL E-TOOL S-TOOL
replaces O
the O
contents O
of O
these O
processes O
with O
the O
first O
and O
second O
decrypted O
executables O
. O

These O
executables O
are O
monitoring O
services O
for O
maintaining O
Dexphot S-MAL
’s O
components O
. O

The O
now-malicious O
processes O
are O
released O
from O
suspension O
and O
run O
. O

Next O
, O
the B-TOOL
loader I-TOOL
DLL E-TOOL S-TOOL
targets O
the O
setup.exe S-FILE
file O
in O
SysWoW64 S-OS
. O

It O
removes O
setup.exe S-FILE
’s O
contents O
and O
replaces O
them O
with O
the O
third O
decrypted O
executable O
, O
a O
cryptocurrency O
miner O
. O

Although O
Dexphot S-MAL
always O
uses O
a O
cryptocurrency O
miner O
of O
some O
kind O
, O
it O
’s O
not O
always O
the O
same O
miner O
. O

It O
used O
different O
programs O
like O
XMRig S-MAL
and O
JCE B-MAL
Miner E-MAL
over O
the O
course O
of O
our O
research O
. O

The O
two O
monitoring O
services O
simultaneously O
check O
the O
status O
of O
all O
three O
malicious O
processes O
. O

Having O
dual O
monitoring O
services O
provides O
redundancy O
in O
case O
one O
of O
the O
monitoring O
processes O
is O
halted O
. O

If O
any O
of O
the O
processes O
are O
terminated O
, O
the O
monitors O
immediately O
identify O
the O
situation O
, O
terminate O
all O
remaining O
malicious O
processes O
, O
and O
re-infect O
the O
device O
. O

The O
monitoring O
components O
also O
detect O
freshly O
launched O
cmd.exe S-FILE
processes O
and O
terminate O
them O
promptly O
. O

As O
a O
final O
fail-safe O
, O
Dexphot S-ACT
uses O
schtasks.exe S-FILE
to O
create O
scheduled O
tasks O
. O

This O
persistence O
technique O
is O
interesting O
, O
because O
it O
employs O
two O
distinct O
MITRE B-TOOL
ATT&CK E-TOOL
techniques O
: O
Scheduled B-TOOL
Task E-TOOL
and O
Signed B-TOOL
Binary I-TOOL
Proxy I-TOOL
Execution E-TOOL
. O

The O
scheduled O
tasks O
call O
msiexec.exe S-FILE
as O
a O
proxy O
to O
run O
the O
malicious O
code O
, O
much O
like O
how O
msiexec.exe S-FILE
was O
used O
during O
installation O
. O

Using O
msiexec.exe S-FILE
, O
a O
legitimate O
system O
process O
, O
can O
make O
it O
harder O
to O
trace O
the O
source O
of O
malicious O
activity O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
tasks O
allow O
Dexphot S-MAL
to O
conveniently O
update O
the O
payload O
from O
the O
web O
every O
time O
the O
tasks O
run O
. O

They O
automatically O
update O
all O
of O
Dexphot S-MAL
’s O
components O
, O
both O
upon O
system O
reboot O
as O
well O
as O
every O
90 O
or O
110 O
minutes O
while O
the O
system O
is O
running O
. O

Dexphot S-MAL
also O
generates O
the O
names O
for O
the O
tasks O
at O
runtime O
, O
which O
means O
a O
simple O
block O
list O
of O
hardcoded O
task O
names O
will O
not O
be O
effective O
in O
preventing O
them O
from O
running O
. O

The O
names O
are O
usually O
in O
a O
GUID O
format O
, O
although O
after O
we O
released O
our O
first O
round O
of O
Dexphot-blocking O
protections O
, O
the O
threat O
authors O
began O
to O
use O
random O
strings O
. O

The O
threat O
authors O
have O
one O
more O
evasion O
technique O
for O
these O
scheduled O
tasks O
: O
some O
Dexphot S-MAL
variants O
copy O
msiexec.exe S-FILE
to O
an O
arbitrary O
location O
and O
give O
it O
a O
random O
name O
, O
such O
as O
%AppData%\<random>.exe S-FILE
. O

This O
makes O
the O
system O
process O
running O
malicious O
code O
a O
literal O
moving O
target O
. O

Dexphot S-MAL
exhibits O
multiple O
layers O
of O
polymorphism O
across O
the O
binaries O
it O
distributes O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
MSI S-TOOL
package O
used O
in O
the O
campaign O
contains O
different O
files O
, O
as O
shown O
in O
the O
table O
below O
. O

The O
MSI S-TOOL
packages O
generally O
include O
a O
clean O
version O
of O
unzIP S-TOOL
. O

exe S-FILE
, O
a O
password-protected O
ZIP O
file O
, O
and O
a O
batch O
file O
that O
checks O
for O
currently O
installed O
antivirus O
products O
. O

However O
, O
the O
batch O
file O
is O
not O
always O
present O
, O
and O
the O
names O
of O
the O
ZIP O
files O
and O
Loader B-TOOL
DLLs E-TOOL
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
password O
for O
extracting O
the O
ZIP O
file O
, O
all O
change O
from O
one O
package O
to O
the O
next O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
contents O
of O
each O
Loader B-TOOL
DLL E-TOOL S-TOOL
differs O
from O
package O
to O
package O
, O
as O
does O
the O
encrypted O
data O
included O
in O
the O
ZIP O
file O
. O

This O
leads O
to O
the O
generation O
of O
a O
different O
ZIP B-TOOL
archive E-TOOL
and O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
a O
unique O
MSI S-TOOL
package O
, O
each O
time O
the O
attacker O
bundles O
the O
files O
together O
. O

Because O
of O
these O
carefully O
designed O
layers O
of O
polymorphism O
, O
a O
traditional O
file-based O
detection O
approach O
wouldn’t O
be O
effective O
against O
Dexphot S-MAL
. O

Besides O
tracking O
the O
files O
and O
processes O
that O
Dexphot S-MAL
uses O
to O
execute O
an O
attack O
, O
we O
have O
also O
been O

, O
mainly O

We O
have O
confirmed O
more O
than O
20 O

has O
been O

but O
increased O
its O
attacks O
in O
2019 S-TIME

In O
our O
research O
, O
we O
were O
also O
able O
to O
track O
two O
groups O
targeting O
the O
hospitality O
sector O
, O
using O
separate O
but O
similar O
infrastructure O
, O
tools O
and O
techniques O
. O

PaloAlto S-IDTY
has O
already O
written O
about O
one O
of O
them O
. O

We O
named O
the O
first O
group O
RevengeHotels S-APT
, O
and O
the O
second O
ProCC S-APT
. O

These O
groups O
use O
a O
lot O
of O
social O
engineering O
in O
their O
attacks O
, O
asking O
for O
a O
quote O
from O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
government O
entity O
or O
private O
company O
wanting O
to O
make O
a O
reservation O
for O
a O
large O
number O
of O
people O
. O

Their O
infrastructure O
also O
relies O
on O
the O
use O
of O
dynamic O
DNS S-PROT
services O
pointing O
to O
commercial O
hosting O
and O
self-hosted O
servers O
. O

They O
also O
sell O
credentials O
from O
the O
affected O
systems O
, O
allowing O
other O
cybercriminals O
to O
have O
remote O
access O
to O
hotel O
front O
desks O
infected O
by O
the O
campaign O
. O

We O
monitored O
the O
activities O
of O
these O
groups O
and O
the O
new O
malware O
they O
are O
creating O
for O
over O
a O
year O
. O

With O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
confidence O
, O
we O
can O
confirm O
that O
at O
least O
two O
distinct O
groups O
are O
focused O
on O
attacking O
this O
sector O
; O
there O
is O
also O
a O
third O
group O
, O
though O
it O
is O
unclear O
if O
its O
focus O
is O
solely O
on O
this O
sector O
or O
if O
carries O
out O
other O
types O
of O
attacks O
. O

One O
of O
the O
tactics O
used O
in O
operations O
by O
these O
groups O
is O
highly O
targeted O
spear-phishing B-ACT
messages E-ACT
. O

They O
register O
typo-squatting O
domains O
, O
impersonating O
legitimate O
companies O
. O

The O
emails S-TOOL
are O
well O
written O
, O
with O
an O
abundance O
of O
detail O
. O

They O
explain O
why O
the O
company O
has O
chosen O
to O
book O
that O
particular O
hotel O
. O

By O
checking O
the O
sender O
information O
, O
it O
’s O
possible O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O
company O
actually O
exists O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
a O
small O
difference O
between O
the O
domain O
used O
to O
send O
the O
email S-TOOL
and O
the O
real O
one O
. O

This O
spear-phishing S-ACT
message O
, O
written O
in O
Portuguese O
, O
has O
a O
malicious O
file O
attached O
misusing O
the O
name O
of O
a O
real O
attorney O
office O
, O
while O
the O
domain O
sender O
of O
the O
message O
was O
registered O
one O
day O
before O
, O
using O
a O
typo-squatting O
domain O
. O

The O
group O
goes O
further O
in O
its O
social O
engineering O
effort O
: O
to O
convince O
the O
hotel O
personnel O
about O
the O
legitimacy O
of O
their O
request O
, O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
National O
Registry O
of O
Legal O
Entities O

file O
that O
drops O
a O
remote O

object O
via O

The O
macro O
code O
inside O
the O
remote O

document O
contains O
PowerShell S-TOOL
commands O
that O
download O
and O
execute O
the O
final O

In O
the O
RevengeHotels S-APT
campaign O
, O
the O

After O

An O
additional O

written O
by O
the O

called O

is O
used O
to O
capture O

It O
monitors O
whether O
the O

In O
the O
initial O
versions O
, O
back O
in O
2016 S-TIME
, O
the O
downloaded O
files O
from O
RevengeHotels S-APT
campaigns O
were O
divided O
into O
two O
modules O
: O
a O
backdoor S-MAL
and O
a O
module O
to O
capture O
screenshots O
. O

Recently O
we O
noticed O
that O
these O
modules O
had O
been O
merged O
into O
a O
single O
backdoor O
module O
able O
to O
collect O
data O
from O
clipboard O
and O
capture O
screenshots O
. O

In O
this O
example O
, O
the O
webpage O
that O
the O
attacker O
is O
monitoring O
is O
booking.com S-DOM
( O
more O
specifically O
, O
the O
page O
containing O
the O

) O
. O

The O
code O
is O
specifically O
looking O
for O
data O
in O
Portuguese O

English O
, O
allowing O
the O
attackers O
to O
steal O
credit O

data O
from O
web O
pages O
written O
in O
these O
languages O
. O

In O
the O
ProCC S-APT
campaigns O
, O
the O
downloaded O
files O
are O
Delphi S-TOOL
binaries O
. O

The O
backdoor S-MAL
installed O
in O
the O
machine O
is O
more O
customized O
than O
that O
used O
by O
RevengeHotels S-APT
: O

is O
able O
to O
collect O
data O
from O
the O
clipboard O
and O
printer O
spooler O
, O
and O
capture O
screenshots O
. O

Because O
the O
personnel O
in O
charge O
of O
confirming O
reservations O
usually O
need O
to O
pull O
credit O
card O
data O
from O
OTA B-TOOL
websites E-TOOL
, O
it O
’s O
possible O
to O
collect O
card O
numbers O
by O
monitoring O
the O
clipboard O
and O
the O
documents O
sent O
to O
the O
printer O
. O

According O
to O
the O
relevant O
underground O
forums O
and O
messaging O
groups O
, O
these O
criminals O
also O
infect O
front O
desk O
machines O
in O
order O
to O
capture O

from O
the O
hotel O
administration O
software O
; O
they O
can O
then O
steal O
credit O

details O
from O
it O
too O
. O

Some O
criminals O
also O
sell O
remote O
access O
to O
these O
systems O
, O
acting O
as O
a O
concierge O
for O
other O
cybercriminals O
by O
giving O
them O
permanent O
access O
to O
steal O
new O

by O
themselves O
. O

Some O
Brazilian B-APT

tout O
credit O

extracted O
from O
a O

The O
majority O
of O
the O
victims O
are O
associated O
with O
the O
hospitality O
sector O

Based O
on O
the O
routines O
used O
, O
we O
estimate O
that O
this O

has O
a O
global O
reach O
. O

Based O
on O
data O
extracted O
from O
Bit.ly S-DOM

, O
we O
can O
see O
that O
potential O

from O
many O
other O
countries O
have O
at O
least O
accessed O
the O

This O

suggests O
that O
the O
number O

is O
higher O
than O

” O
Now O
, O
three O
years O
later O
, O
we O
have O
the O
evidence O
required O
to O
change O
our O
assessment O
. O

The O
details O
we O
have O
analyzed O
during O
hundreds O
of O
investigations O
convince O
us O
that O
the O
groups O
conducting O
these O
activities O
are O
based O
primarily O
in O
China S-LOC
and O
that O
the O
Chinese O
Government O
is O
aware O
of O
them O
. O

Mandiant S-SECTEAM
continues O
to O
track O
dozens O
of O
APT O
groups O
around O
the O
world O
; O
however O
, O
this O
report O
is O
focused O
on O
the O
most O
prolific O
of O
these O
groups O
. O

We O
refer O
to O
this O
group O
as O
“ O
APT1 S-APT
” O
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
more O
than O
20 O
APT O
groups O
with O
origins O
inChina S-LOC
. O

APT1 S-APT
is O
a O
single O
organization O
of O
operators O
that O
has O
conducted O
a O
cyber B-ACT
espionage E-ACT
campaign O
against O
a O
broad O
range O
of O
victims O
since O
at O
least O
2006 S-TIME
. O

From O
our O
observations O
, O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prolific O
cyber B-ACT
espionage E-ACT
groups O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
sheer O
quantity O
of O
information O
stolen O
. O

The O
scale O
and O
impact O
of O
APT1 S-APT
’s O
operations O
compelled O
us O
to O
write O
this O
report O
. O

The O
activity O
we O
have O
directly O
observed O
likely O
represents O
only O
a O
small O
fraction O
of O
the O
cyber B-ACT
espionage E-ACT
that O
APT1 S-APT
has O
conducted O
. O

Though O
our O
visibility O
of O
APT1 S-APT
’s O
activities O
is O
incomplete O
, O
we O
have O
analyzed O
the O
group O
’s O
intrusions O
against O
nearly O
150 O
victims O
over O
seven O
years O
. O

From O
our O
unique O
vantage O
point O
responding O
to O
victims O
, O
we O
tracked O
APT1 S-APT
back O
to O
four O
large O
networks O
in O
Shanghai S-LOC
, O
two O
of O
which O
are O
allocated O
directly O
to O
the O
Pudong B-LOC
New I-LOC
Area E-LOC
. O

We O
uncovered O
a O
substantial O
amount O
of O
APT1 S-APT
’s O
attack O
infrastructure O
, O
command O
and O
control O
, O
and O
modus O
operandi O
( O

) O
. O

In O
an O
effort O
to O
underscore O
there O
are O
actual O
individuals O
behind O
the O
keyboard O
, O
Mandiant S-SECTEAM
is O
revealing O
three O
personas O
we O
have O
attributed O
to O
APT1 S-APT
. O

These O
operators O
, O
like O
soldiers O
, O
may O
merely O
be O
following O
orders O
given O
to O
them O
by O
others O
. O

Our O
analysis O
has O
led O
us O
to O
conclude O
that O
APT1 S-APT
is O
likely O
government-sponsored O
and O
one O
of O
the O
most O
persistent O
of O
China S-LOC
’s O
cyber O
threat O
actors O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
APT1 S-APT
is O
able O
to O
wage O
such O
a O
long-running O
and O
extensive O
cyber B-ACT
espionage E-ACT
campaign O
in O
large O
part O
because O
it O
receives O
direct O
government O
support O
. O

In O
seeking O
to O
identify O
the O
organization O
behind O
this O
activity O
,our O

found O
that O

its O
mission O

The O

considered O
by O

that O
is O
12 O

and O
was O
built O
in O
early O
2007 S-TIME

APT1 S-APT
has O
systematically O
stolen O
hundreds O
of O
terabytes O
of O
data O
from O
at O
least O
141 O
organizations O
, O
and O
has O
demonstrated O
the O
capability O
and O
intent O
to O
steal O
from O
dozens O
of O
organizations O
simultaneously O
. O

Since O
2006 S-TIME
, O
Mandiant S-SECTEAM
has O
observed O
APT1 S-APT
compromise O
141 O
companies O
spanning O
20 O
major O
industries O
. O

APT1 S-APT
has O
a O
well-defined O
attack O
methodology O
, O
honed O
over O
years O
and O
designed O
to O
steal O
large O
volumes O
of O
valuable O
intellectual O
property O
. O

Once O
APT1 S-APT
has O
established O
access O
, O
they O
periodically O
revisit O
the O
victim O
’s O
network O
over O
several O
months O
or O
years O
and O
steal O
broad O
categories O
of O
intellectual O
property O
, O
including O
technology O
blueprints O
, O
proprietary O
manufacturing O

, O
and O
emails S-TOOL
and O

from O

. O

APT1 S-APT
uses O
some O
tools O
and O
techniques O
that O
we O
have O
not O
yet O
observed O
being O
used O
by O
other O
groups O
including O
two O
utilities O
designed O
to O
steal O

Establishing O
a O
foothold O
involves O
actions O
that O
ensure O
control O
of O
the O
target O
network O
’s O
systems O
from O
outside O
the O
network O
. O

APT1 S-APT
establishes O
a O
foothold O
once O
email S-TOOL
recipients O
open O
a O
malicious O
file O
and O
a O
backdoor O
is O
subsequently O
installed O
. O

A O
backdoor O
is O
software O
that O
allows O
an O
intruder O
to O
send O
commands O
to O
the O
system O
remotely O
. O

In O
almost O
every O
case O
, O
APT O
backdoors O
initiate O
outbound O
connections O
to O
the O
intruder O
’s O
“ O
command O
and O
control O
” O
( O
C2 S-TOOL
) O
server O
. O

APT O
intruders O
employ O
this O
tactic O
because O
while O
network O
firewalls O
are O
generally O
adept O
at O
keeping O
malware O
outside O
the O
network O
from O
initiating O
communication O
with O
systems O
inside O
the O
network O
, O
they O
are O
less O
reliable O
at O
keeping O
malware O
that O
is O
already O
inside O
the O
network O
from O
communicating O
to O
systems O
outside O
. O

While O
APT1 S-APT
intruders O
occasionally O
use O
publicly O
available O
backdoors O
such O
as O
Poison B-MAL
Ivy E-MAL
and O
Gh0st B-MAL
RAT E-MAL
, O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
time O
they O
use O
what O
appear O
to O
be O
their O
own O
custom O
backdoors O
. O

We O
will O
describe O
APT1 S-APT
’s O
backdoors O
in O
two O
categories O
: O
“ O
Beachhead O
Backdoors O
” O
and O
“ O
Standard O
Backdoors. O


” OBeachhead O
backdoors O
are O
typically O
minimally O
featured O
. O

They O
offer O
the O
attacker O
a O
toe-hold O
to O
perform O
simple O
tasks O
like O
retrieve O
files O
, O
gather O
basic O
system O
information O
and O
trigger O
the O
execution O
of O
other O
more O
significant O
capabilities O
such O
as O
a O
standard O
backdoor O
. O

APT1 S-APT
’s O
beachhead O
backdoors O
are O
usually O
what O
we O
call O
WEBC2 B-MAL
backdoors E-MAL
. O

WEBC2 B-MAL
backdoors E-MAL
are O
probably O
the O
most O
well-known O
kind O
of O
APT1 S-APT
backdoor O
, O
and O
are O
the O
reason O
why O
some O
security O
companies O
refer O
to O
APT1 S-APT
as O
the O
“ O
Comment O
Crew. O


” O
A O
WEBC2 B-MAL
backdoor E-MAL
is O
designed O
to O
retrieve O
a O
webpage O
from O
a O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
. O

It O
expects O
the O
webpage O
to O
contain O
special O
HTML S-TOOL
tags O
; O
the O
backdoor O
will O
attempt O
to O
interpret O
the O
data O
between O
the O
tags O
as O
commands O
. O

Older O
versions O
of O
WEBC2 S-MAL
read O
data O
between O
HTML S-TOOL
comments O
, O
though O
over O
time O
WEBC2 S-MAL
variants O
have O
evolved O
to O
read O
data O
contained O
within O
other O
types O
of O
tags O
. O

From O
direct O
observation O
, O
we O
can O
confirm O
that O
APT1 S-APT
was O
using O
WEBC2 B-MAL
backdoors E-MAL
as O
early O
as O
July B-TIME
2006 E-TIME
. O

However O
, O
the O
first O
compile O
time35 O
we O
have O
for O
WEBC2 S-MAL
is O
2004-01-23 S-TIME
, O
suggesting O
that O
APT1 S-APT
has O
been O
crafting O
WEBC2 B-MAL
backdoors E-MAL
since O
early O
2004 S-TIME
. O

Based O
on O
the O
400+ O
samples O
of O
WEBC2 S-MAL
variants O
that O
we O
have O
accumulated O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
APT1 S-APT
has O
direct O
access O
to O
developers O
who O
have O
continually O
released O
new O
WEBC2 S-MAL
variants O
for O
over O
six O
years O
. O

WEBC2 B-MAL
backdoors E-MAL
are O
often O
packaged O
with O
spear B-ACT
phishing E-ACT
emails S-TOOL
. O

Once O
installed O
, O
APT1 S-APT
intruders O
have O
the O
option O
to O
tell O
victim O
systems O
to O
download O
and O
execute O
additional O
malicious O
software O
of O
their O
choice O
. O

WEBC2 B-MAL
backdoors E-MAL
work O
for O
their O
intended O
purpose O
, O
but O
they O
generally O
have O
fewer O
features O
than O
the O
“ O
Standard O
Backdoors O
” O
described O
below O
. O

The O
standard O
, O
non-WEBC2 S-MAL
APT1 S-APT
backdoor O
typically O
communicates O
using O
the O
HTTP S-PROT
protocol O
( O
to O
blend O
in O
with O
legitimate O
web O
traffic O
) O
or O
a O
custom O
protocol O
that O
the O
malware O
authors O
designed O
themselves O
. O

These O
backdoors O
give O
APT O
intruders O
a O
laundry O
list O
of O
ways O
to O
control O
victim O
systems O
. O

The O
BISCUIT B-MAL
backdoor E-MAL
( O
so O
named O
for O
the O
command O
“ O
bdkzt S-MAL
” O
) O
is O
an O
illustrative O
example O
of O
the O
range O
of O
commands O
that O
APT1 S-APT
has O
built O
into O
its O
“ O
standard O
” O
backdoors O
. O

APT1 S-APT
has O
used O
and O
steadily O
modified O
BISCUIT S-MAL
since O
as O
early O
as O
2007 O
and O
continues O
to O
use O
it O
presently O
. O

Some O
APT O
backdoors O
attempt O
to O
mimic O
legitimate O
Internet O
traffic O
other O
than O
the O
HTTP S-PROT
protocol O
. O

When O
network O
defenders O
see O
the O
communications O
between O
these O
backdoors O
and O
their O
C2 S-TOOL
servers O
, O
they O
might O
easily O
dismiss O
them O
as O
legitimate O
network O
traffic O
. O


APT1 S-APT
. O

APT1 S-APT
maintains O
an O
extensive O
infrastructure O
of O
computers O
around O
the O
world O
. O

We O
have O
evidence O
suggesting O
that O
APT1 S-APT
manually O
controls O
thousands O
of O
systems O
in O
support O
of O
their O
attacks O
, O
and O
have O
directly O
observed O
their O
control O
over O
hundreds O
of O
these O
systems O
. O

Although O
they O
control O
systems O
in O
dozens O
of O
countries O
, O
their O
attacks O
originate O
from O
four O
large O
networks O
in O
Shanghai S-LOC

which O
are O
allocated O

The O
sheer O

. O

To O
help O
manage O
the O
vast O
number O
of O
systems O
they O
control O
, O
APT1 S-APT
has O
registered O
hundreds O
of O
domain O
names O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
which O
also O
point O
to O
a O
Shanghai S-LOC
locale O
. O

The O
domain O
names O
and O
IP O
addresses O
together O
comprise O
APT1 S-APT
’s O
command B-TOOL
and I-TOOL
control E-TOOL
framework O
which O
they O
manage O
in O
concert O
to O
camouflage O
their O
true O
origin O
from O
their O
English O
speaking O
targets O
. O

As O
covered O
in O
the O
previous O
“ O
Attack O
Lifecycle O
” O
section O
, O
WEBC2 B-MAL
backdoor E-MAL
variants O
download O
and O
interpret O
data O
stored O
between O
tags O
in O
HTML S-TOOL
pages O
as O
commands O
. O

They O
usually O
download O
HTML S-TOOL
pages O
from O
a O
system O
within O
APT1 S-APT
’s O
hop O
infrastructure O
. O

We O
have O
observed O
APT1 S-APT
intruders O
logging O
in O
to O
WEBC2 S-MAL
servers O
and O
manually O
editing O
the O
HTML S-TOOL
pages O
that O
backdoors O
will O
download O
. O

Because O
the O
commands O
are O
usually O
encoded O
and O
difficult O
to O
spell O
from O
memory O
, O
APT1 S-APT
intruders O
typically O
do O
not O
type O
these O
strings O
, O
but O
instead O
copy O
and O
paste O
them O
into O
the O
HTML S-TOOL
files O
. O

They O
likely O
generate O
the O
encoded O
commands O
on O
their O
own O
systems O
before O
pasting O
them O
in O
to O
an O
HTML S-TOOL
file O
hosted O
by O
the O
hop O
point O
. O

For O
example O
, O
we O
observed O
an O
APT O
attacker O
pasting O
the O
string O
“ O
czo1NA== O
” O
into O
an O
HTML S-TOOL
page O
. O

That O
string O
is O
the O
base64 S-ENCR
encoded O
version O
of O
“ O
s O
: O
54 O
” O
, O
meaning O
“ O
sleep O
for O
54 O
minutes O
” O
( O
or O
hours O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
particular O
backdoor O
) O
. O

In O
lieu O
of O
manually O
editing O
an O
HTML S-TOOL
file O
on O
a O
hop O
point O
, O
we O
have O
also O
observed O
APT1 S-APT
intruders O
uploading O
new O
( O
already-edited O
) O
HTML S-TOOL
files O
. O

When O
APT1 S-APT
attackers O
are O
not O
using O
WEBC2 S-MAL
, O
they O
require O
a O
“ O
command B-TOOL
and I-TOOL
control E-TOOL
” O
( O
C2 S-TOOL
) O
user O
interface O
so O
they O
can O
issue O
commands O
to O
the O
backdoor O
. O

This O
interface O
sometimes O
runs O
on O
their O
personal O
attack O
system O
, O
which O
is O
typically O
in O
Shanghai S-LOC
. O

In O
these O
instances O
, O
when O
a O
victim O
backdoor O
makes O
contact O
with O
a O
hop O
, O
the O
communications O
need O
to O
be O
forwarded O
from O
the O
hop O
to O
the O
intruder O
’s O
Shanghai S-LOC
system O
so O
the O
backdoor O
can O
talk O
to O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
software O
. O

We O
have O
observed O
767 O
separate O
instances O
in O
which O
APT1 S-APT
intruders O
used O
the O
publicly O
available O
“ O
HUC B-TOOL
Packet I-TOOL
Transmit I-TOOL
Tool E-TOOL
” O
or O
HTRAN S-TOOL
on O
a O
hop O
. O

As O
always O
, O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
these O
uses O
are O
confirmed O
uses O
, O
and O
likely O
represent O
only O
a O
small O
fraction O
of O
APT1 S-APT
’s O
total O
activity O
. O

The O
HTRAN S-TOOL
utility O
is O
merely O
a O
middle-man O
, O
facilitating O
connections O
between O
the O
victim O
and O
the O
attacker O
who O
is O
using O
the O
hop O
point O
. O

Typical O
use O
of O
HTRAN S-TOOL
is O
fairly O
simple O
: O
the O
attacker O
must O
specify O
the O
originating O
IP O
address O
( O
of O
his O
or O
her O
workstation O
in O
Shanghai S-LOC
) O
, O
and O

, O
the O

Occasionally O
, O
APT1 S-APT

have O
installed O

rather O
than O

However O
, O
it O

We O
have O
observed O

That O

, O
this O
server O

receives O
connections O
from O
victim O

, O
displays O
them O

and O
then O
translates O
the O

that O
the O

In O
the O

However O
, O
we O

This O

will O
delve O
into O
another O
prominent O
group O
of O
attackers O
referred O
to O
as O
“ O
IXESHE S-APT
” O
( O
pronounced O
“ O

one O
of O
the O
more O
common O

the O

they O
utilize O
. O

This O
campaign O
is O
notable O
for O
targeting O
East O
Asian O
governments O
, O
electronics O
manufacturers O
, O
and O
a O
telecommunications O
company O
. O

The O
IXESHE S-APT
campaign O
makes O
use O
of O
targeted O
emails S-TOOL
with O
malicious O
attachments O
to O
compromise O
victims O
’ O
systems O
. O

The O
emails S-TOOL
are O
often O
tailored O
for O
specific O
victims O
and O
contain O
malicious O
attachments O
that O
are O
almost O
always O
“ O
weaponized O
” O
.PDF S-FILE
files O
with O
known O
exploits O
that O
drop O
malware O
executables O
onto O
targeted O
systems O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
IXESHE S-APT
attackers O
conducted O
two O
specific O
attacks O
that O
leveraged O
zero-day S-VULNAME
exploits—one O
in O
2009 O
and O
another O
in O
2011 O
. O

The O
IXESHE S-APT
attackers O
almost O
always O
make O
use O
of O
compromised O
servers O
as O
command-and-control S-TOOL
( O
C&C S-TOOL
) O
servers O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
compromised O
servers O
are O
hosted O
on O
target O
organizations O
’ O
networks O
after O
successful O
infiltration O
so O
the O
attackers O
can O
increase O
their O
control O
of O
the O
victims O
’ O
infrastructure O
. O

Using O
this O
approach O
, O
the O
attackers O
amassed O
at O
least O
60 O
C&C S-TOOL
servers O
over O
time O
. O

This O
technique O
also O
allows O
the O
attackers O
to O
cover O
their O
tracks O
, O
as O
having O
the O
C&C S-TOOL
server O
in O
the O
victims O
’ O
corporate O
networks O
means O
very O
little O
C&C S-TOOL

by O
confusing O
their O

Looking O
at O

over O

primarily O
based O
on O
the O

the O

used O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
develop O
indicators O
of O

for O
the O
IXESHE S-APT
campaign O
. O

The O
malware O
samples O
used O
in O
this O
campaign O
were O
not O
very O
complicated O
by O
nature O
but O
do O
give O
the O
attackers O
almost O
complete O

their O

. O

Most O
of O
the O
IP O

of O
IXESHE S-APT

victims O
are O
linked O
to O
DSL S-TOOL

, O
which O
made O
it O
difficult O
to O
determine O
their O

While O

it O
is O
unclear O
if O
APT12 S-APT

responsible O
for O
the O

Similarly O
, O
WATERSPOUT S-MAL

However O
, O
the O
WATERSPOUT S-MAL

shared O
several O
traits O
with O
the O
RIPTIDE S-MAL

HIGHTIDE S-MAL

that O
we O
have O
attributed O
to O
APT12 S-APT

From O
October O
2012 O

the O

These O

be O
temporary O

Although O
these O

not O
definitively O
tie O

they O
do O
indicate O

, O
the O
THREEBYTE S-MAL

APT12 S-APT

FireEye S-SECTEAM
believes O
the O

HIGHTIDE S-MAL
represents O
a O
temporary O
tool O
shift O
to O
decrease O

while O
APT12 S-APT
developed O
a O
completely O
new O

These O
development O
efforts O
may O
have O
resulted O
in O
the O
emergence O
of O
the O

Though O

resulted O
in O
APT12 S-APT

, O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
observed O
only O
a O
brief O
pause O
in O
APT12 S-APT

before O
the O

the O
public O
disclosure O
of O
APT12 S-APT

at O
the O
New B-IDTY

appear O
to O
be O
mounting O
fresh O

that O
leverage O
new O
and O
improved O
versions O
of O

. O

The O
new O
campaigns O
mark O
the O
first O
significant O
stirrings O
from O
the O
group O
since O
it O
went O
silent O
in O

in O
the O

of O
a O
detailed O

its O

and O
a O
retooling O
of O
what O
security O
researchers O
believe O
is O
a O
massive O
spying O
operation O
based O
in O
China S-LOC

The O
newest O
campaign O
uses O
updated O
versions O
of O
Aumlib S-MAL
and O
Ixeshe S-MAL
. O

Aumlib S-MAL
, O
which O
for O
years O
has O
been O
used O
in O
targeted O
attacks O
, O
now O
encodes O
certain O
HTTP S-PROT
communications O
. O

FireEye S-SECTEAM
researchers O
spotted O
the O
malware O
when O
analyzing O
a O
recent O
attempted O
attack O
on O
an O
organization O
involved O
in O
shaping O
economic O
policy O
. O

And O
a O
new O
version O
of O
Ixeshe S-MAL
, O
which O
has O
been O
in O
service O
since O
2009 O
to O
attack O
targets O
in O
East B-LOC
Asia E-LOC
, O
uses O
new O
network O
traffic O
patterns O
, O
possibly O
to O
evade O
traditional O
network O
security O
systems O
. O

The O
updates O
are O
significant O
for O
both O
of O
the O
longstanding O
malware O
families O
; O
before O
this O
year O
, O
Aumlib S-MAL
had O
not O
changed O
since O
at O
least O
May O
2011, O
and O
Ixeshe O
had O
not O
evolved O
since O
at O
least O
December O
2011 O
. O

Cybercriminals O
are O
constantly O
evolving O
and O
adapting O
in O
their O
attempts O
to O
bypass O
computer O
network O
defenses O
. O

But O
, O
larger O
, O
more O
successful O
threat O
actors O
tend O
to O
evolve O
at O
a O
slower O
rate O
. O

As O
long O
as O
these O
actors O
regularly O
achieve O
their O
objective O
( O
stealing O
sensitive O
data O
) O
, O
they O
are O
not O
motivated O
to O
update O
or O
rethink O
their O
techniques O
, O
tactics O
, O
or O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
. O

These O
threat O
actors O
’ O
tactics O
follow O
the O
same O
principles O
of O
evolution O
– O
successful O
techniques O
propagate O
, O
and O
unsuccessful O
ones O
are O
abandoned O
. O

Attackers O
do O
not O
change O
their O
approach O
unless O
an O
external O
force O
or O
environmental O
shift O
compels O
them O
to O
. O

As O
the O
old O
saying O
goes O
: O
If O
it O
ain’t O
broke O
, O
don’t O
fix O
it O
. O

So O
when O
a O
larger O
, O
successful O
threat O
actor O
changes O
up O
tactics O
, O
the O
move O
always O
piques O
our O
attention O
. O

Naturally O
, O
our O
first O
priority O
is O
ensuring O
that O
we O
detect O
the O
new O
or O
altered O
TTPs O
. O

But O
we O
also O
attempt O
to O
figure O
out O
why O
the O
adversary O
changed O
— O
what O
broke? O
— O
so O
that O
we O
can O
predict O
if O
and O
when O
they O
will O
change O
again O
in O
the O
future O
. O

We O
observed O
an O
example O
of O
this O
phenomenon O
around O
May O
. O

About O
four O
months O
after O
The O
New B-IDTY
York I-IDTY
Times E-IDTY
publicized O
an O
attack O
on O
its O
network O
, O
the O
attackers O
behind O
the O
intrusion O
deployed O
updated O
versions O
of O
their O
Backdoor.APT.Aumlib S-FILE
and O
Backdoor.APT.Ixeshe S-FILE
malware O
families O
. O

The O
previous O
versions O
of O
Aumlib S-MAL
had O
not O
changed O
since O
at O
least O
May O
2011, O
and O
Ixeshe O
had O
not O
evolved O
since O
at O
least O
December O
2011 O
. O

We O
cannot O
say O
for O
sure O
whether O
the O
attackers O
were O
responding O
to O
the O
scrutiny O
they O
received O
in O
the O
wake O
of O
the O
episode O
. O

But O
we O
do O
know O
the O
change O
was O
sudden O
. O

Akin O
to O
turning O
a O
battleship O
, O
retooling O
TTPs O
of O
large O
threat O
actors O
is O
formidable O
. O

Such O
a O
move O
requires O
recoding O
malware O
, O
updating O
infrastructure O
, O
and O
possibly O
retraining O
workers O
on O
new O
processes O
. O

Taiwanese O
citizens O
will O
go O
to O
the O
polls O
on O
January O
16 O
, O
2016 O
, O
to O
choose O
a O
new O
President O
and O
legislators O
. O

According O
to O
recent O
opinion O
polls O
, O
the O
Democratic B-IDTY
Progressive I-IDTY
Party E-IDTY
( O
DPP S-IDTY
) O
candidate O
Tsai O
Ing-wen O
is O
leading O
her O
opponents O
and O
is O
widely O
expected O
to O
win O
the O
election O
. O

The O
DPP O
is O
part O
of O
the O
pan-green O
coalition O
that O
favors O
Taiwanese O
independence O
over O
reunification O
with O
the O
mainland O
, O
and O
the O
party O
’s O
victory O
would O
represent O
a O
shift O
away O
from O
the O
ruling O
Kuomintang O
’s O
closer O
ties O
with O
the O
PRC S-IDTY
. O

Since O
1949 O
, O
Beijing S-LOC
has O
claimed O
Taiwan S-LOC
as O
a O
part O
of O
China S-LOC
and O
strongly O
opposes O
any O
action O
toward O
independence O
. O

The O
Chinese B-IDTY
government E-IDTY
is O
therefore O
concerned O
whether O
a O
DPP S-IDTY
victory O
might O
weaken O
the O
commercial O
and O
tourism O
ties O
between O
China S-LOC
and O
Taiwan S-LOC
, O
or O
even O
drive O
Taiwan S-LOC
closer O
to O
independence O
. O

In O
2005 O
, O
the O
Chinese B-IDTY
government E-IDTY
passed O
an O
“ O
anti-secession O
” O
law O
that O
signified O
its O
intention O
to O
use O
“ O
non-peaceful O
” O
means O
to O
stymie O
any O
Taiwanese O
attempt O
to O
secede O
from O
China S-LOC
. O

APT16 S-APT
actors O
sent O
spear B-ACT
phishing E-ACT
emails S-TOOL
to O
two O
Taiwanese O
media O
organization O
addresses O
and O
three O
webmail O
addresses O
. O

The O
message O
subject O
read O
“ O
DPP S-IDTY
’s O
Contact O
Information O
Update O
” O
, O
apparently O
targeting O
those O
interested O
in O
contact O
information O
for O
DPP S-IDTY
members O
or O
politicians O
. O

The O
Chinese B-IDTY
government E-IDTY
would O
benefit O
from O
improved O
insight O
into O
local O
media O
coverage O
of O
Taiwanese O
politics O
, O
both O
to O
better O
anticipate O
the O
election O
outcome O
and O
to O
gather O
additional O
intelligence O
on O
politicians O
, O
activists O
, O
and O
others O
who O
interact O
with O
journalists O
. O

This O
tactic O
is O
not O
without O
precedent O
; O
in O
2013 O
, O
the O
New B-IDTY
York I-IDTY
Times E-IDTY
revealed O
it O
had O
been O
the O
target O
of O
China S-LOC
based O
actors O
shortly O
after O
it O
reported O
on O
the O
alleged O
mass O
accumulation O
of O
wealth O
by O
then-Prime O
Minister O
Wen O
Jiabao O
and O
his O
family O
. O

The O
actors O
likely O
sought O
information O
on O
the O
newspaper O
’s O
sources O
in O
China S-LOC
, O
who O
could O
be O
silenced O
by O
the O
government O
. O

Compromising O
these O
Taiwanese O
news O
organizations O
would O
also O
allow O
the O
actors O
to O
gain O
access O
to O
informants O
or O
other O
protected O
sources O
, O
who O
might O
then O
be O
targeted O
for O
further O
intelligence O
collection O
or O
even O
retribution O
. O

The O
webmail O
addresses O
, O
while O
unknown O
, O
were O
possibly O
the O
personal-use O
addresses O
of O
the O
individuals O
whose O
corporate O
domain O
emails S-TOOL
were O
targeted O
. O

As O
corporate O
networks O
become O
more O
secure O
and O
users O
become O
more O
vigilant O
, O
personal O
accounts O
can O
still O
offer O
a O
means O
to O
bypass O
security O
systems O
. O

This O
tactic O
exploits O
users O
’ O
reduced O
vigilance O
when O
reading O
their O
own O
personal O

, O
even O
when O
using O
corporate O

to O
do O
so O
. O

On O
the O
same O
date O
that O
APT16 S-APT
targeted O
Taiwanese O

, O
suspected O
Chinese O
APT O

It O
is O

although O
not O
confirmed O
, O
that O
APT16 S-APT
was O
also O
responsible O
for O
targeting O
this O

APT17 S-APT
went O

employed O
a O
multi-layered O
approach O
for O
the O

This O
additional O
obfuscation O
puts O
yet O
another O
layer O

attempting O
to O
chase O

FIN7.5 S-APT

On O
August B-TIME

2018 E-TIME
, O
the O
US S-LOC
Department B-IDTY
of I-IDTY

announced O
that O
it O
had O
arrested O
several O
individuals O
suspected O
of O
having O
ties O
to O
the O
FIN7 S-APT
cybercrime O
rig O
. O

FIN7 S-APT
operations O
are O
linked O
to O
numerous O
intrusion O
attempts O
having O
targeted O
hundreds O
of O
companies O
since O
at O
least O
as B-TIME
early I-TIME
as I-TIME
2015 E-TIME
. O

Interestingly O
, O
this O
threat O
actor O
created O
fake O
companies O
in O
order O
to O
hire O
remote O
pentesters O
, O
developers O
and O
interpreters O
to O
participate O
in O
their O
malicious O
business O
. O

The O
main O
goal O
behind O
its O
malicious O
activities O
was O
to O
steal O
financial O
assets O
from O
companies O
, O
such O
as O
debit O

, O
or O
get O
access O
to O

In O
2018-2019 S-TIME

analyzed O
various O

the O

and O
Procedures O
( O

) O
as O
the O
historic O
FIN7 S-APT
, O
leading O
the O
researchers O
to O
believe O
that O
this O
threat O
actor O
had O
remained O
active O
despite O
the O
2018 S-TIME
arrests O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
during O
the O
investigation O
, O
we O
discovered O
certain O
similarities O
to O
other O
attacker O
groups O
that O
seemed O
to O
share O
or O
copy O
the O
FIN7 S-APT
TTPs O
in O
their O

operations O
. O

The O
FIN7 S-APT
intrusion O
set O
continued O
its O
tailored O
spear B-ACT
phishing E-ACT
campaigns O
throughout O
last B-TIME
year E-TIME
. O

Kaspersky B-SECTEAM
Lab E-SECTEAM
has O
been O
able O
to O
retrieve O
some O
of O
these O
exchanges O
from O
a O
FIN7 S-APT
target O
. O

The O
spear B-ACT
phishing E-ACT
campaigns O
were O
remarkably O
sophisticated O
from O
a O
social O
engineering O
perspective O
. O

In O
various O
cases O
, O
the O
operators O
exchanged O
numerous O
messages O
with O
their O
victims O
for O
weeks O
before O
sending O
their O
malicious O
documents O
. O

The O
emails S-TOOL
were O
efficient O
social-engineering O
attempts O
that O
appealed O
to O
a O
vast O
number O
of O
human O
emotions O
( O
fear O
, O
stress O
, O
anger O
, O
etc. O


) O
to O
elicit O
a O
response O
from O
their O
victims O
. O

One O
of O
the O
domains O
used O
by O
the O
attackers O
in O
their O
2018 S-TIME
campaign O
of O
spear B-ACT
phishing E-ACT
contained O
more O
than O
130 O
email S-TOOL
aliases O
, O
leading O
us O
to O
think O
that O
more O
than O
130 O
companies O
had O
been O
targeted O
by O
the B-TIME
end I-TIME
of I-TIME
2018 E-TIME
. O

We O
have O
seen O
two O
types O
of O
documents O
sent O
to O
victims O
in O
these O
spear B-ACT
phishing E-ACT
campaigns O
. O

The O
first O
one O
exploits O
the O
INCLUDEPICTURE S-TOOL
feature O
of O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Word S-TOOL
to O
get O
context O
information O
about O
the O
victim’s O
computer O
, O
and O
the O
availability O
and O
version O
number O
of O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Word S-TOOL
. O

The O
second O
one O
, O
which O
in O
many O
cases O
is O
an O
Office S-TOOL
document O
protected O
with O
a O
trivial O
password O
, O
such O
as O
“ O
12345 O
” O
, O
“ O
1234 O
” O
, O
etc. O


, O
uses O
macros S-TOOL
to O
execute O
a O
GRIFFON S-MAL
implant O
on O
the O
target’s O
computer O
. O

In O
various O
cases O
, O
the O
associated O
macro S-TOOL
also O
scheduled O
tasks O
to O
make O
GRIFFON S-MAL
persistent O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
following O
some O
open-source O
publications O
about O
them O
, O
the O
FIN7 S-APT
operators O
seems O
to O
have O
developed O
a O
homemade O
builder O
of O
malicious O
Office S-TOOL
document O
using O
ideas O
from O
ThreadKit S-MAL
, O
which O
they O
employed O
during O
the B-TIME
summer I-TIME
of I-TIME
2018 E-TIME
. O

The O
new O
builder O
inserts O
random O
values O
in O
the O
Author O
and O
Company O
metadata O
fields O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
builder O
allows O
these O
to O
modify O
different O
IOCs S-TOOL
, O
such O
as O
the O
filenames O
of O
wscript.exe S-FILE
or O
sctasks.exe S-FILE
copies O
, O
etc O
. O

The O
GRIFFON S-MAL
implant O
is O
a O
lightweight O
JScript S-TOOL
validator-style O
implant O
without O
any O
persistence O
mechanism O
. O

The O
malware O
is O
designed O
for O
receiving O
modules O
to O
be O
executed O
in-memory O
and O
sending O
the O
results O
to O
C2s O
. O

We O
were O
able O
to O
obtain O
four O
different O
modules O
during O
the O
investigation O
. O

The O
first O
module O
downloaded O
by O
the O
GRIFFON S-MAL
malware O
to O
the O
victim’s O
computer O
is O
an O
information-gathering O
JScript S-TOOL
, O
which O
allows O
the O
cybercriminals O
to O
understand O
the O
context O
of O
the O
infected O
workstation O
. O

This O
module O
mainly O
relies O
on O
WMI S-TOOL
and O
Windows S-OS
objects O
to O
deliver O
results O
, O
which O
will O
be O
sent O
back O
to O
the O
operators O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
more O
than O
20 O
artifacts O
are O
retrieved O
from O
the O
system O
by O
this O
implant O
during O
the O
reconnaissance O
stage O
, O
from O
the O
date O
and O
time O
of O
operating O
system O
installation O
and O
membership O
in O
a O
Windows S-OS
domain O
to O
a O
list O
of O
and O
the O
resolutions O
of O
the O
workstation’s O
monitors O
. O

The O
second O
module O
is O
used O
by O
the O
operators O
to O
execute O
an O
obfuscated O
PowerShell S-TOOL
script O
, O
which O
contains O
a O
Meterpreter S-TOOL
downloader S-TOOL
widely O
known O
as O
“ O
Tinymet S-TOOL
“ O
. O

This O
downloader S-TOOL
, O
seen O
in O
past O
FIN7 S-APT
campaigns O
, O
downloads O
a O
one-byte O
XOR S-ENCR
encrypted O
( O
eg. O


with O
the O
key O
equal O
to O
0x50 O
or O
0x51 O
) O
piece O
of O
meterpreter S-TOOL
shellcode O
to O
execute O
. O

The O
third O
module O
allows O
the O
operators O
to O
take O
a O
screenshot O
of O
the O
remote O
system O
. O

To O
do O
that O
, O
it O
also O
drops O
a O
PowerShell S-TOOL
script O
on O
the O
workstation O
to O
execute O
. O

The O
script O
executes O
an O
open-source O
.NET S-FILE
class O
used O
for O
taking O
a O
screenshot O
. O

The O
resulting O
screenshot O
is O
saved O
at O
“ O
%TMP%/image.png S-FILE
” O
, O
sent O
back O
to O
the O
attackers O
by O
the O
GRIFFON S-MAL
implant O
and O
then O
deleted O
. O

The O
last O
retrieved O
module O
is O
a O
persistence O
module O
. O

If O
the O
victim O
appears O
valuable O
to O
the O
attackers O
, O
a O
GRIFFON S-MAL
implant O
installer S-TOOL
is O
pushed O
to O
the O
victim’s O
workstation O
. O

This O
module O
stores O
another O
instance O
of O
the O
GRIFFON S-MAL
implant O
inside O
the O
registry O
to O
achieve O
persistence O
. O

Here O
is O
a O
PowerLinks S-TOOL
style O
method O
used O
by O
the O
attackers O
to O
achieve O
persistence O
and O
execute O
the O
GRIFFON S-MAL
implant O
at O
each O
user O
logon O
. O

The O
new O
GRIFFON S-MAL
implant O
is O
written O
to O
the O
hard O
drive O
before O
each O
execution O
, O
limiting O
the O
“ O
file-less O
” O
aspect O
of O
this O
method O
. O

Through O
its O
light O
weight O
and O
modular O
architecture O
, O
the O
GRIFFON S-MAL
implant O
is O
the O
perfect O
validator O
. O

Even O
though O
we O
have O
been O
able O
to O
retrieve O
four O
different O
modules O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
FIN7 S-APT
operators O
have O
more O
modules O
in O
their O
toolsets O
for O
achieving O
their O
objectives O
on O
the O
victim’s O
workstation O
. O

Attackers O
make O
mistakes O
, O
and O
FIN7 S-APT
are O
no O
exception O
. O

The O
major O
error O
made O
by O
its O
operators O
allowed O
us O
to O
follow O
the O
command O
and O
control O
server O
of O
the O
GRIFFON S-MAL
implant O
last B-TIME
year E-TIME
. O

In O
order O
to O
trick O
blue O
teams O
and O
other O
DFIR S-TOOL
analysts O
, O
the O
operators O
created O
fake O
HTTP S-PROT
302 O
redirection O
to O
various O
Google S-IDTY
services O
on O
their O
C2s O
servers O
. O

This O
error O
allowed O
us O
to O
follow O
the O
infrastructure O
week O
by O
week O
, O
until O
an O
individual O
pushed O
on O
Twitter S-IDTY
the O
heuristic O
to O
track O
their O
C2 S-TOOL
at O
the B-TIME
end I-TIME
of I-TIME
December I-TIME
2018 E-TIME
. O

A O
few O
days O
after O
the O
tweet O
, O
in O
January B-TIME
2019 E-TIME
, O
the O
operators O
changed O
their O
landing O
page O
in O
order O
to O
prevent O
this O
type O
of O
tracking O
against O
their O
infrastructure O
. O

During O
the O
investigation O
related O
to O
the O
GRIFFON S-MAL
infrastructure O
, O
we O
found O
a O
strange O
overlap O
between O
the O
WHOIS S-TOOL
record O
of O
an O
old O
GRIFFON S-MAL
C2 S-TOOL
and O
the O
website O
of O
a O
fake O
company O
. O

According O
to O
the O
website O
, O
that O
domain O
supposedly O
belongs O
to O
a O
legitimate O
security O
company O
“ O
fully O
owned O

says O
the O

Given O
FIN7 S-APT

we O
decided O
to O
look O
deeper O

As O
we O
were O
looking O
at O
the O
content O

it O
became O

that O
almost O
all O

The O

we O
decided O
to O
disclose O
a O
few O
hints O
regarding O
these O
in O
this O

post O
. O

In O
his O
history O
, O
FIN7 S-APT
has O
overlapped O
several O
times O
with O
Cobalt S-MAL/EmpireMonkey S-MAL
in O
terms O
of O
TTPs O
. O

This O
activity O
cluster O
, O
which O
Kaspersky O

At O
the B-TIME

earlier B-TIME
this I-TIME

A O
few O
interesting O
overlaps O
in O
recent O
FIN7 S-APT
campaigns O
: O
Both O
used O
macros S-TOOL
to O
copy O
wscript.exe S-FILE

which O
began O
with O
“ O
ms O

( O
mses.exe S-FILE

FIN7 S-APT
, O
msutil.exe S-FILE

EmpireMonkey S-MAL
) O
. O

Both O
executed O
a O
JScript S-TOOL

named O
“ O

in O
%TEMP% O
( O
Errors.txt S-FILE
in O
the O
case O
of O
FIN7 S-APT
, O
Errors.bat S-FILE
for O
EmpireMonkey S-MAL
) O
. O

Both O
used O
DocuSign S-TOOL

The O
macros S-TOOL
popped O
the O
same O
“ O

We O
have O
a O
high O
level O
of O
confidence O
in O
a O
historic O
association O
between O
FIN7 S-APT

Cobalt S-MAL
, O
even O
though O
we O
believe O
that O
these O
two O

are O
operated O
by O
different O
teams O
. O

AveMaria S-MAL
is O
a O

, O
right O
after O
the O

We O
have O
medium O
confidence O
that O
this O
botnet O
falls O
under O
the O
FIN7 S-APT

In O
fact O

They O
also O
use O
AutoIT S-TOOL
droppers O
, O
password-protected O
EXE S-TOOL
files O
and O
even O
ISO S-TOOL
images O
. O

What O
is O
interesting O
, O
in O
some O
emails S-TOOL
, O
they O
ask O
targets O
to O
phone O
them O
if O
they O
have O
any O
questions O
, O
like O
the O
FIN7 S-APT
guys O
do O
. O

During O
the O
investigation O
into O
FIN7 S-APT
, O
our O
threat-hunting O
systems O
found O
an O
interesting O
overlap O
in O
between O
the O
infrastructure O
of O
FIN7 S-APT
and O
AveMaria S-MAL
. O

Basically O
, O
two O
servers O
in O
the O
same O
IP O
range O
and O
AS14576 O
( O
autonomous O
system O
) O
share O
a O
non-standard O
SSH S-PROT
port O
, O
which O
is O
222 O
. O

One O
of O
the O
servers O
is O
a O
Griffon S-MAL
C2, O
and O
the O
other O
one O
, O
an O
AveMaria S-MAL
C2 S-TOOL
. O

Distribution O
of O
targets O
is O
another O
factor O
suggesting O
that O
these O
two O
malware O
families O
may O
be O
connected O
. O

We O
analyzed O
AveMaria S-MAL
targets O
during O
February B-TIME
and I-TIME
March I-TIME
of I-TIME
2019 E-TIME
. O

The O
spearphishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
were O
sent O
to O
various O
kinds O
of O
businesses O
only O
and O
did O
not O
target O
individuals O
. O

Thirty O
percent O
of O
the O
targets O
were O
small O
and O
medium-sized O
companies O
that O
were O
suppliers O
or O
service O
providers O
for O
bigger O
players O
and O
21% O
were O
various O
types O
of O
manufacturing O
companies O
. O

We O
also O
spotted O
several O
typical O
FIN7 S-APT
targets O
, O
such O
as O
retailers O
and O
hotels O
. O

Most O
AveMaria S-MAL
targets O
( O
72% O
) O
were O
in O
the O
EU S-IDTY
. O

At O
the B-TIME
end I-TIME
of I-TIME
2018 E-TIME
, O
while O
searching O
for O
new O
FIN7 S-APT
campaigns O
via O
telemetry O
, O
we O
discovered O
a O
set O
of O
activity O
that O
we O
temporarily O
called O
“ O
CopyPaste S-APT
” O
from O
a O
previously O
unknown O
APT O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
this O
actor O
targeted O
financial O
entities O
and O
companies O
in O
one O
African O
country O
, O
which O
lead O
us O
to O
think O
that O
CopyPaste S-APT
was O
associated O
with O
cybermercenaries O
or O
a O
training O
center O
. O

This O
set O
of O
activity O
relied O
on O
open-source O
tools O
, O
such O
as O
Powershell S-TOOL
Empire S-TOOL
, O
and O
well-documented O
red O
teaming O
techniques O
, O
in O
order O
to O
get O
a O
foothold O
within O
the O
victim’s O
networks O
and O
avoid O
detection O
. O

The O
links O
between O
CopyPaste S-APT
and O
FIN7 S-APT
are O
still O
very O
weak O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
CopyPaste S-APT
operators O
were O
influenced O
by O
open-source O
publications O
and O
do O
not O
have O
any O
ties O
with O
FIN7 S-APT
. O

During O
2018 S-TIME
, O
Europol S-IDTY
and O
DoJ S-IDTY
announced O
the O
arrest O
of O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
FIN7 S-APT
and O
Carbanak S-APT/CobaltGoblin S-APT
cybercrime O
groups O
. O

It O
was O
believed O
that O
the O
arrest O
of O
the O
group O
leader O
will O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
the O
group’s O
operations O
. O

However O
, O
recent O
data O
seems O
to O
indicate O
that O
the O
attacks O
have O
continued O
without O
significant O
drawbacks O
. O

One O
may O
say O
CobaltGoblin S-APT
and O
FIN7 S-APT
have O
even O
extended O
the O
number O
of O
groups O
operating O
under O
their O
umbrella O
. O

We O
observe O
, O
with O
various O
level O
of O
confidence O
, O
that O
there O
are O
several O
interconnected O
groups O
using O
very O
similar O
toolkits O
and O
the O
same O
infrastructure O
to O
conduct O
their O
cyberattacks O
. O

The O
first O
of O
them O
is O
the O
well-known O
FIN7 S-APT
, O
which O
specializes O
in O
attacking O
various O
companies O
to O
get O
access O
to O
financial O
data O
or O
PoS S-TOOL
infrastructure O
. O

They O
rely O
on O
a O
Griffon S-MAL
JS S-TOOL
backdoor O
and O
Cobalt S-MAL/Meterpreter S-TOOL
, O
and O
in O
recent O
attacks O
, O
Powershell S-TOOL
Empire S-TOOL
. O

The O
second O
one O
is O
CobaltGoblin S-APT/Carbanak S-APT/EmpireMonkey S-APT
, O
which O
uses O
the O
same O
toolkit O
, O
techniques O
and O
similar O
infrastructure O
but O
targets O
only O
financial O
institutions O
and O
associated O
software/services O
providers O
. O

We O
link O
the O
AveMaria S-MAL
botnet O
to O
these O
two O
groups O
with O
medium O
confidence O
: O
AveMaria S-MAL
’s O
targets O
are O
mostly O
suppliers O
for O
big O
companies O
, O
and O
the O
way O
AveMaria S-MAL
manages O
its O
infrastructure O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
FIN7 S-APT
. O

The O
last O
piece O
is O
the O
newly O
discovered O
CopyPaste S-APT
group O
, O
who O
targeted O
financial O
entities O
and O
companies O
in O
one O
African O
country O
, O
which O
lead O
us O
to O
think O
that O
CopyPaste S-APT
was O
associated O
with O
cybermercenaries O
or O
a O
training O
center O
. O

The O
links O
between O
CopyPaste S-APT
and O
FIN7 S-APT
are O
still O
very O
weak O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
operators O
of O
this O
cluster O
of O
activity O
were O
influenced O
by O
open-source O
publications O
and O
do O
not O
have O
any O
ties O
with O
FIN7 S-APT
. O

All O
of O
the O
aforementioned O
groups O
greatly O
benefit O
from O
unpatched O
systems O
in O
corporate O
environments O
. O

They O
thus O
continue O
to O
use O
effective O
spearphishing S-ACT
campaigns O
in O
conjunction O
with O
well-known O
MS S-IDTY
Office S-TOOL
exploits O
generated O
by O
the O
framework O
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
groups O
have O
not O
used O
any O
zero-days S-VULNAME
. O

FIN7 S-APT/Cobalt S-MAL
phishing E-ACT
documents O
may O
seem O
basic O
, O
but O
when O
combined O
with O
their O
extensive O
social O
engineering O
and O
focused O
targeting O
, O
they O
are O
quite O
successful O
. O

As O
with O
their O
previous O
fake O
company O
“ O
Combi B-IDTY
Security E-IDTY
” O
, O
we O
are O
confident O
that O
they O
continue O
to O
create O
new O
personas O
for O
use O
in O
either O
targeting O
or O
recruiting O
under O
a O
“ O
new O
” O
brand O
, O
“ O
IPC S-IDTY
” O

ScarCruft S-APT
continues O
to O
evolve, O
introduces O
Bluetooth S-TOOL
harvester O
. O

After O
publishing O
our O
initial O
series O
of O
blogposts O
back O
in O
2016 S-TIME
, O
we O
have O
continued O
to O
track O
the O
ScarCruft S-APT
threat O
actor O
. O

ScarCruft S-APT
is O
a O
Korean-speaking O
and O
allegedly O
state-sponsored O
threat O
actor O
that O
usually O
targets O
organizations O
and O
companies O
with O
links O
to O
the O
Korean O
peninsula O
. O

We O
recently O
discovered O
some O
interesting O
telemetry O
on O
this O
actor O
, O
and O
decided O
to O
dig O
deeper O
into O
ScarCruft S-APT
’s O
recent O
activity O
. O

This O
shows O
that O
the O
actor O
is O
still O
very O
active O
and O
constantly O
trying O
to O
elaborate O
its O
attack O
tools O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
telemetry O
, O
we O
can O
reassemble O
ScarCruft S-APT
’s O
binary O
infection O
procedure O
. O

It O
used O
a O
multi-stage O
binary O
infection O
to O
update O
each O
module O
effectively O
and O
evade O
detection O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
victims O
of O
this O
campaign O
and O
spotted O
an O
interesting O
overlap O
of O
this O
campaign O
with O
another O
APT O
actor O
known O
as O
DarkHotel S-APT
. O

The O
ScarCruft S-APT
group O
uses O
common O
malware O
delivery O
techniques O
such O
as O
spear B-ACT
phishing E-ACT
and O
Strategic B-ACT
Web I-ACT
Compromises E-ACT
( O
SWC S-ACT
) O
. O

As O
in O
Operation B-ACT
Daybreak E-ACT
, O
this O
actor O
performs O
sophisticated O
attacks O
using O
a O
zero-day S-MAL
exploit O
. O

However O
, O
sometimes O
using O
public O
exploit O
code O
is O
quicker O
and O
more O
effective O
for O
malware O
authors O
. O

We O
witnessed O
this O
actor O
extensively O
testing O
a O
known O
public O
exploit O
during O
its O
preparation O
for O
the O
next O
campaign O
. O

In O
order O
to O
deploy O
an O
implant O
for O
the O
final O
payload O
, O
ScarCruft S-APT
uses O
a O
multi-stage O
binary O
infection O
scheme O
. O

As O
a O
rule O
, O
the O
initial O
dropper O
is O
created O
by O
the O
infection O
procedure O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
notable O
functions O
of O
the O
initial O
dropper O
is O
to O
bypass O
Windows S-OS
UAC S-TOOL
( O
User B-TOOL
Account I-TOOL
Control E-TOOL
) O
in O
order O
to O
execute O
the O
next O
payload O
with O
higher O
privileges O
. O

This O
malware O
uses O
the O
public O
privilege O
escalation O
exploit O
code O
CVE-2018-8120 S-VULID
or O
UACME S-VULNAME
which O
is O
normally O
used O
by O
legitimate O
red O
teams O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
the O
installer S-TOOL
malware O
creates O
a O
downloader O
and O
a O
configuration O
file O
from O
its O
resource O
and O
executes O
it O
. O

The O
downloader S-TOOL
malware O
uses O
the O
configuration O
file O
and O
connects O
to O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
to O
fetch O
the O
next O
payload O
. O

In O
order O
to O
evade O
network O
level O
detection O
, O
the O
downloader S-TOOL
uses O
steganography O
. O

The O
downloaded O
payload O
is O
an O
image O
file O
, O
but O
it O
contains O
an O
appended O
malicious O
payload O
to O
be O
decrypted O
. O

The O
final O
payload O
created O
by O
the O
aforementioned O
process O
is O
a O
well O
known O
backdoor O
, O
also O
known O
as O
ROKRAT S-MAL
by O
Cisco B-SECTEAM
Talos E-SECTEAM
. O

This O
cloud O
service-based O
backdoor O
contains O
many O
features O
. O

One O
of O
its O
main O
functions O
is O
to O
steal O
information O
. O

Upon O
execution O
, O
this O
malware O
creates O
10 O
random O
directory O
paths O
and O
uses O
them O
for O
a O
specially O
designated O
purpose O
. O

The O
malware O
creates O
11 O
threads O
simultaneously O
: O
six O
threads O
are O
responsible O
for O
stealing O
information O
from O
the O
infected O
host O
, O
and O
five O
threads O
are O
for O
forwarding O
collected O
data O
to O
four O
cloud O
services O
( O
Box S-TOOL
, O
Dropbox S-TOOL
, O
Pcloud S-TOOL
and O
Yandex S-TOOL
) O
. O

When O
uploading O
stolen O
data O
to O
a O
cloud O
service O
, O
it O
uses O
predefined O
directory O
path O
such O
as O
/english O
, O
/video O
or O
/scriptout O
. O

The O
ScarCruft S-APT
group O
keeps O
expanding O
its O
Exfiltration S-ACT
targets O
to O
steal O
further O
information O
from O
infected O
hosts O
and O
continues O
to O
create O
tools O
for O
additional O
data O
Exfiltration S-ACT
. O

We O
also O
discovered O
an O
interesting O
piece O
of O
rare O
malware O
created O
by O
this O
threat O
actor O
– O
a O
Bluetooth S-TOOL
device O
harvester O
. O

This O
malware O
is O
responsible O
for O
stealing O
Bluetooth S-TOOL
device O
information O
. O

It O
is O
fetched O
by O
a O
downloader O
, O
and O
collects O
information O
directly O
from O
the O
infected O
host O
. O

This O
malware O
uses O
Windows S-OS
Bluetooth S-TOOL
APIs O
to O
find O
information O
on O
connected O
Bluetooth S-TOOL
devices O
and O
saves O
the O
following O
information O
. O

We O
have O
found O
several O
victims O
of O
this O
campaign O
, O
based O
on O
our O
telemetry O
– O
investment O
and O
trading O
companies O
in O
Vietnam S-LOC
and O
Russia S-LOC
. O

We O
believe O
they O
may O
have O
some O
links O
to O
North B-LOC
Korea E-LOC
, O
which O
may O
explain O
why O
ScarCruft S-APT
decided O
to O
closely O
monitor O
them O
. O

ScarCruft S-APT
also O
attacked O
a O
diplomatic O
agency O
in O
Hong B-LOC
Kong E-LOC
, O
and O
another O
diplomatic O
agency O
in O
North B-LOC
Korea E-LOC
. O

It O
appears O
ScarCruft S-APT
is O
primarily O
targeting O
intelligence O
for O
political O
and O
diplomatic O
purposes O
. O

We O
discovered O
one O
victim O
from O
Russia S-LOC
that O
also O
triggered O
a O
malware O
detection O
while O
staying O
in O
North B-LOC
Korea E-LOC
in O
the O
past O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
this O
victim O
visits O
North B-LOC
Korea E-LOC
makes O
its O
special O
and O
suggests O
that O
it O
may O
have O
valuable O
information O
about O
North O
Korean O
affairs O
. O

ScarCruft S-APT

But O
before O
the O

however O
, O
another O

with O
GreezeBackdoor S-MAL

GreezeBackdoor S-MAL
is O
a O

of O
the O
DarkHotel S-APT

we O
have O
previously O

was O
also O
attacked O
by O
the O

on O

) O
This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
we O
have O
seen O
an O
overlap O
of O
ScarCruft S-APT
and O
DarkHotel S-APT
actors O
. O

Members O
from O
our O
team O
have O
already O
presented O
on O
the O
conflict O
of O
these O
two O

We O
have O
also O
shared O
more O
details O
with O
our O

They O
are O
both O
Korean-speaking O
threat O
actors O

sometimes O
their O
victimology O

But O
both O
group O
seem O
to O
have O
different O
TTPs O
( O
Tactics O

and O
it O
leads O
us O
to O
believe O
that O
one O
group O
regularly O
lurks O
in O
the O
other O

shadow O
. O

The O
ScarCruft S-APT
has O
shown O
itself O
to O
be O
a O
highly-skilled O

It O
has O
a O

To O
understand O
its O
capabilities O
, O
the O
macro S-TOOL

has O
been O
isolated O
and O
analyzed O
in O

. O

Surprisingly O
, O
the O

is O
composed O
by O
more O
than O
1600 O
lines O
of O

it O
is O
highly O

Paying O
more O
attention O
during O
the O

, O
we O
discovered O
that O
it O

full O
of O
junk O

never O

Only O
a O

the O

Once O

The O
“ O

” O
sample O
actually O
is O
a O
Self B-TOOL
Extracting I-TOOL
Archive E-TOOL
( O
SFX S-TOOL/SFA S-TOOL
) O
containing O
four O
files O
designed O
to O
be O
extracted O
in O
the O
%TEMP% O
folder O
. O

After O
that O
, O
it O
executes O
“ O
exit.exe S-FILE
” O
which O
launches O
the O
“ O
i.cmd S-FILE
” O
batch O
script O
. O

This O
new O
script O
performs O
a O
ping O
to O
“ O
www[.cloudflare[.com S-DOM
” O
for O
three O
times O
with O
a O
delay O
of O
3000ms O
, O
testing O
the O
connectivity O
of O
the O
victim O
machine O
. O

If O
the O
host O
is O
successfully O
reached O
, O
the O
script O
renames O
a O
file O
named O
“ O
kernel.dll S-FILE
” O
, O
obviously O
not O
the O
real O
one O
, O
in O
“ O
uninstall.exe S-FILE
” O
, O
another O
misleading O
name O
. O

Then O
it O
invokes O
the O
renamed O
executable O
and O
runs O
it O
passing O
a O
series O
of O
parameter O
: O
“ O
uninstall.exe S-FILE
x O
-pQELRatcwbU2EJ5 O
-y O
” OThese O
parameters O
are O
needed O
to O
self-decrypt O
the O
“ O
uninstall.exe S-FILE
” O
file O
which O
is O
again O
another O
SFX S-TOOL
archive O
. O

The O
“ O
-p O
” O
parameter O
, O
indeed O
, O
specify O
the O
password O
of O
the O
archive O
to O
be O
extracted O
. O

The O
crucial O
file O
, O
at O
this O
point O
of O
the O
infection O
, O
is O
the O
SFX S-TOOL
executable O
named O
“ O
uninstall.exe S-FILE
” O
. O

It O
has O
a O
structure O
similar O
to O
previous O
“ O
wprgxyeqd79.exe S-FILE
” O
file O
: O
two O
of O
their O
files O
have O
the O
same O
name O
, O
but O
the O
content O
of O
this O
new O
SFX S-TOOL
is O
extracted O
in O
the O
“ O
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Windows S-OS
Anytime O
Upgrade O
” O
directory O
. O

Another O
time O
, O
the O
execution O
flow O
moves O
from O
“ O
exit.exe S-FILE
to O
“ O
i.cmd S-FILE
” O
. O

The O
script O
is O
quite O
different O
from O
the O
previous O
one O
: O
it O
guarantees O
its O
persistence O
on O
the O
victim O
machine O
through O
the O
setting O
of O
“ O
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run O
” O
registry O
key O
, O
creating O
a O
new O
entry O
named O
“ O
Windows S-OS
Anytime O
Upgrade O
” O
which O
points O
to O
“ O
winserv.exe S-FILE
” O
, O
just O
stored O
into O
the O
same O
folder O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
script O
provides O
to O
run O
“ O
winserv.exe S-FILE
” O
. O

An O
interesting O
part O
of O
the O
script O
is O
the O
continuous O
killing O
of O
every O
“ O
rundll32.exe S-FILE
” O
process O
running O
into O
the O
victim O
machine O
, O
generates O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
noise O
, O
as O
visible O
in O
the O
following O
process O
explorer O
view O
. O

Anyway O
, O
just O
before O
the O
kill O
loop O
, O
the O
real O
malicious O
payload O
is O
executed O
: O
the O“ O
winserv.exe S-FILE

. O

Analyzing O

acts O
as O
a O
remote O

tool O
, O
allowing O
the O
attacker O
to O
gain O
complete O
access O
to O
the O

Together O
with O
the O
RMS S-TOOL
executable O
, O
there O
is O
another O
file O
named O
“ O
settings.dat S-FILE
” O
containing O
the O
custom O
configuration O
prepared O
by O
the O
attacker O
. O

It O
contains O
information O
like O
: O

connect O

The O

The O

All O
these O

are O
automatically O
loaded O

firstly O
stored O
in O
the O

At O

the O

will O
directly O
load O
the O

The O

establishes O
a O

After O
the O
reconstruction O
of O
the O
full O
infection O

, O
we O
noticed O
strong O
similarities O
with O
a O
recent O

The O

The O
comparison O
of O

reveals O
in O
both O
cases O
the O
attacker O
used O
a O
couple O
of O
SFX S-TOOL

to O
deploy O
the O
“ O

The O

The O
peculiarity O

Winnti S-MAL
malware O
handles O
outbound O

using O
multiple O
protocols O
including O
: O
ICMP S-PROT
, O
HTTP S-PROT
, O
as O
well O
as O
custom O
TCP S-PROT
and O
UDP S-PROT
protocols O
. O

Use O
of O
these O
protocols O
is O
thoroughly O
documented O
in O
the O
Novetta S-SECTEAM
and O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
reports O
. O

While O
the O
outbound O
communication O
mechanisms O
are O
well O
documented O
, O
less O
attention O
has O
been O
paid O
to O
a O
feature O
of O
recent O
versions O
of O
Winnti S-MAL
we O
came O
across O
in O
the O
Linux S-OS
variant O
( O
as O
well O
as O
Windows S-OS
) O
that O
allows O
the O
operators O
to O
initiate O
a O
connection O
directly O
to O
an O
infected O
host O
, O
without O
requiring O
a O
connection O
to O
a O
control O
server O
. O

This O
secondary O
communication O
channel O
may O
be O
used O
by O
operators O
when O
access O
to O
the O
hard-coded O
control O
servers O
is O
disrupted O
. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
operators O
could O
leverage O
this O
feature O
when O
infecting O
internet-facing O
devices O
in O
a O
targeted O
organization O
to O
allow O
them O
to O
reenter O
a O
network O
if O
evicted O
from O
internal O
hosts O
. O

This O
passive O
implant O
approach O
to O
network O
persistence O
has O
been O
previously O
observed O
with O
threat O
actors O
like O
Project B-TOOL
Sauron E-TOOL
and O
the O
Lamberts S-TOOL
. O

Initial O
technical O
information O
about O
this O
feature O
was O
shared O
by O
the O
Thyssenkrupp B-IDTY
CERT E-IDTY
in O
the O
form O
of O
an O
Nmap S-TOOL
script O
that O
could O
be O
used O
to O
identify O
Winnti S-MAL
infections O
through O
network O
scanning O
. O

This O
script O
identifies O
infected O
hosts O
by O
first O
sending O
a O
custom O
hello O
packet O
, O
immediately O
followed O
by O
an O
encoded O
request O
for O
host O
information O
, O
and O
then O
parsing O
the O
response O
. O

The O
initial O
request O
, O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
helo/hello O
request O
in O
the O
Nmap S-TOOL
script O
, O
is O
comprised O
of O
four O
DWORDs S-TOOL
. O

The O
first O
three O
are O
generated O
by O
rand() S-TOOL
and O
the O
fourth O
is O
computed O
based O
on O
the O
first O
and O
third O
. O

When O
received O
by O
a O
Winnti S-MAL
infected O
host O
, O
it O
will O
validate O
the O
received O
packet O
and O
listen O
for O
a O
second O
inbound O
request O
containing O
tasking O
. O

This O
second O
request O
( O
Encoded O
Get O
System O
Information O
Request O
) O
is O
encoded O
using O
the O
same O
method O
as O
the O
custom O
TCP S-PROT
protocol O
used O
for O
communication O
with O
command-and-control O
servers O
, O
which O
uses O
a O
four-byte O
XOR S-ENCR
encoding O
. O

Before O
acting O
on O
the O
request O
, O
Winnti S-MAL
will O
validate O
the O
third O
DWORD S-TOOL
contains O
the O
magic O
value O
0xABC18CBA O
before O
executing O
tasking O
. O

we O

March E-TIME

Our O
analysis O
has O
led O
us O
to O
conclude O
that O
APT1 S-APT
is O
likely O
government-sponsored O
and O
one O
of O
the O
most O
persistent O
of O
China S-LOC
's O
cyber B-APT
threat I-APT
actors E-APT

FireEye S-SECTEAM
said O
it O
has O
tracked O
admin@338 S-APT

activity O
since O
2013 S-TIME

the O

largely O
targeted O
organizations O
involved O
in O
financial S-IDTY
, O
economic S-IDTY
, O
and O
trade B-IDTY
policy E-IDTY
. O

The O
simplest O
conclusion O
based O
on O
these O
facts O
is O
that O
APT1 S-APT
is O
operating O
in O
China S-LOC
, O
and O
most O
likely O
in O
Shanghai S-LOC
. O

These O
data O
sets O
show O
that O
APT1 S-APT
is O
either O
operating O
in O
China S-LOC
during O
normal O
Chinese S-LOC
business O
hours O
or O
that O
APT1 S-APT
is O
intentionally O
going O
to O
painstaking O
lengths O
to O
look O
like O
they O
are O
. O

APT1 S-APT
has O
used O

early O
as O
2007 S-TIME

it O
presently O

While O
APT1 S-APT
intruders O
occasionally O
use O
publicly B-MAL
available I-MAL
backdoors E-MAL
such O
as O
Poison B-MAL
Ivy E-MAL

Given O
the O
mission O
, O
resourcing O
, O
and O

, O
we O
conclude O
that O
PLA B-APT
Unit I-APT
61398 E-APT
is O
APT1 S-APT
. O

APT1 S-APT
were O
a O
highly O
prolific O

However O
, O
the O

shared O
several O
traits O
with O
the O
RIPTIDE S-MAL

HIGHTIDE B-MAL

that O
we O
have O
attributed O
to O
APT12 S-APT

From O
October B-TIME

Georgian O

issues O
, O
particularly O
with O

The O
Dukes S-APT
are O
a O
well-resourced O
, O
highly O
dedicated O
and O
organized O
cyberespionage S-ACT
group O
that O
we O
believe O
has O
been O
working O
for O
the O
Russian S-LOC
Federation O
since O
at O
least O
2008 S-TIME
to O
collect O
intelligence O
in O
support O
of O
foreign O
and O
security O
policy O
decision-making O
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
are O
known O
to O
employ O
a O
vast O
arsenal O
of O
malware O
toolsets O
, O
which O
we O
identify O
as O
MiniDuke S-MAL
, O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
, O
OnionDuke S-MAL
, O
CozyDuke S-MAL
, O
CloudDuke S-MAL
, O
SeaDuke S-MAL
, O
HammerDuke S-MAL
, O
PinchDuke S-MAL
, O
and O
GeminiDuke S-MAL
. O

The O
origins O
of O
the O
Duke O
toolset O
names O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
when O
researchers O
at O
Kaspersky B-SECTEAM
Labs E-SECTEAM
coined O
the O
term O
" O
MiniDuke S-MAL
" O
to O
identify O
the O
first O
Duke-related S-MAL
malware S-MAL
they O
found O
. O

As O
researchers O
continued O
discovering O
new O
toolsets O
that O
were O
created O
and O
used O
by O
the O
same O
group O
that O
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke S-MAL
, O
and O
thus O
the O
threat O
actor O
operating O
the O
toolsets O
started O
to O
be O
commonly O
referred O
to O
as O
" O
Dukes S-APT
" O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
campaign O
identifiers O
found O
in O
PinchDuke B-MAL
samples E-MAL
discovered O
from O
2009 S-TIME
, O
the O
targets O
of O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group E-APT
during O
that O
year O
included O
organizations O
such O
as O
the O
Ministry B-IDTY
of I-IDTY
Defense E-IDTY
of O
Georgia O
and O
the O
ministries B-IDTY
of I-IDTY
foreign I-IDTY
affairs E-IDTY
of O
Turkey S-LOC
and O
Uganda S-LOC
. O

Importantly O
, O
PinchDuke B-MAL
trojan I-MAL
samples E-MAL
alACTs O
contain O
a O
notable O
text O
string O
, O
which O
we O
believe O
is O
used O
as O
a O
campaign O
identifier O
by O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group E-APT
to O
distinguish O
between O
multiple O
attack B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
that O
are O
run O
in O
parallel O
. O

This O
neatly O
ties O
together O
many O
of O
the O
tools O
used O
by O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group E-APT
, O
as O
versions O
of O
this O
one O
loader O
have O
been O
used O
to O
load O
malware O
from O
three O
different O
Dukes-related O
toolsets O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
, O
PinchDuke S-MAL
, O
and O
MiniDuke S-MAL
– O
over O
the O
course O
of O
five O
years O
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
continued O
the O
expansion O
of O
their O
arsenal O
in O
2011 S-TIME
with O
the O
addition O
of O
two O
more O
toolsets O
: O
MiniDuke S-MAL
and O
CozyDuke S-MAL
. O

As O
we O
now O
know O
, O
by O
February B-TIME
2013 E-TIME
the O
Dukes B-APT
group E-APT
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke S-MAL
and O
other O
toolsets O
for O
at O
least O
4 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
value O
the O
Dukes S-APT
intended O
to O
gain O
from O
these O
MiniDuke B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
may O
have O
been O
so O
great O
that O
they O
deemed O
it O
worth O
the O
risk O
of O
getting O
noticed O
. O

This O
is O
in O
stark O
contrast O
to O
some O
other O
suspected O
Russian S-LOC
threat O
actors S-APT
( O
such O
as O
Operation B-ACT
Pawn I-ACT
Storm E-ACT
) O
who O
appear O
to O
have O
increased O
their O
targeting O
of O
Ukraine S-LOC
following O
the O
crisis O
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
actively O
targeted O
Ukraine S-LOC
before O
the O
crisis O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Russia S-LOC
was O
still O
weighing O
her O
options O
, O
but O
once O
Russia S-LOC
moved O
from O
diplomacy O
to O
direct O
action O
, O
Ukraine S-LOC
was O
no O
longer O
relevant O
to O
the O
Dukes S-APT
in O
the O
same O
ACT O
. O

In O
the O
latter O
case O
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group E-APT
appear O
to O
have O
also O
simultaneously O
developed O
an O
entirely O
new O
loader O
, O
which O
we O
first O
observed O
being O
used O
in O
conjunction O
with O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
during O
the O
spring B-TIME
of I-TIME
2015 E-TIME
. O

The O
Dukes S-APT
could O
have O
ceased O
all O
use O
of O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
( O
at O
least O
until O
they O
had O
developed O
a O
new O
loader O
) O
or O
retired O
it O
entirely O
, O
since O
they O
still O
had O
other O
toolsets O
available O
. O

For O
these O
CozyDuke B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
however O
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
appear O
to O
have O
employed O
two O
particular O
later-stage O
toolsets O
, O
SeaDuke S-MAL
and O
HammerDuke S-MAL
. O

Firstly O
, O
as O
with O
the O
MiniDuke B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
of O
February B-TIME
2013 E-TIME
and O
CosmicDuke B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
in O
the O
summer B-TIME
of I-TIME
2014 E-TIME
, O
again O
the O
group O
clearly O
prioritized O
the O
continuation O
of O
their O
operations O
over O
maintaining O
stealth O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
notably O
overt O
and O
large-scale O
campaigns S-ACT
with O
CozyDuke S-ACT
and O
CloudDuke S-ACT
, O
the O
Dukes S-APT
also O
continued O
to O
engage O
in O
more O
covert O
, O
surgical O
campaigns S-ACT
using O
CosmicDuke S-MAL
. O

We O
are O
however O
only O
aware O
of O
one O
instance O
- O
the O
exploitation O
of O
CVE-2013-0640 S-VULID
to O
deploy O
MiniDuke S-MAL
- O
where O
we O
believe O
the O
exploited O
vulnerability O
was O
a O
zero-day S-VULNAME
at O
the O
time O
that O
the O
group O
acquired O
the O
exploit S-VULNAME
. O

All O
of O
the O
available O
evidence O
however O
does O
in O
our O
opinion O
suggest O
that O
the O
group O
operates O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
Russian S-LOC
Federation O
. O

This O
assertion O
of O
time O
zone O
is O
also O
supported O
by O
timestamps O
found O
in O
many O
GeminiDuke B-MAL
samples E-MAL
, O
which O
similarly O
suggest O
the O
group O
work O
in O
the O
Moscow O
Standard O
TIME O
timezone O
, O
as O
further O
detailed O
in O
the O
section O

POSHSPY S-MAL
in O
several O

two O

In O
the O
investigations O
Mandiant S-SECTEAM

it O
appeared O
that O

POSHSPY S-MAL
as O
a O
secondary O
backdoor O
for O
use O
if O
they O
lost O
access O

APT38 S-APT

carefully O
conducting O

although O

We O
consider O
APT38 S-APT

operations O
more O
global O

highly O
specialized O

the O
financial B-IDTY

. O

APT38 S-APT
is O
a O
financially O
motivated O
group O
linked O
to O
North B-LOC
Korean E-LOC
cyber B-APT
espionage I-APT
operators E-APT
, O
renown O
for O
attempting O
to O
steal O
hundreds O

millions O
of O
dollars O
from O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
and O
their O
brazen O
use O
of O

. O

Because O
APT38 S-APT
is O
backed O
by O
( O
and O
acts O
on O

of O
) O
the O
North B-LOC
Korean E-LOC
regime O
, O
we O
opted O
to O
categorize O
the O
group O
as O
an O
" O

" O
instead O
of O
a O
" O

Over O

these O

diverged O

as O

TTPs O

almost O
certainly O
indicating O
that O
TEMP.Hermit B-ACT

is O
made O
up O
of O
multiple O
operational B-APT
groups E-APT
primarily O
linked O
together O
with O
shared O

development O
resources O
and O
North B-LOC
Korean E-LOC
state O

. O

Based O
on O
observed O
activity O
, O
we O
judge O
that O
APT38 S-APT
's O
primary O
mission O
is O
targeting O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
and O
manipulating O
inter-bank O
financial O
systems O
to O
raise O
large O
sums O
of O
money O
for O
the O
North B-LOC
Korean E-LOC
regime O
. O

Since O
2015 S-TIME
, O
APT38 S-APT
has O
attempted O
to O
steal O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
dollars O
from O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
. O

APT38 S-APT
has O
pursued O
their O
main O
objective O
of O
targeting O
banks S-IDTY
and O
financial B-IDTY
entities E-IDTY
since O
at O
least O
2014 S-TIME
. O

We O
surmise O
that O
the O
targeting O
of O
banks S-IDTY
, O
media S-IDTY
, O
and O
government B-IDTY
agencies E-IDTY
is O
conducted O
in O
support O
of O
APT38 S-APT
's O
primary O
mission O
. O

The O
APT38 S-APT
targeted O
news B-IDTY
outlets E-IDTY
known O
for O
their O
business O
and O
financial B-IDTY
sector E-IDTY
reporting O
, O
probably O
in O
support O
of O
efforts O
to O
identify O
and O
compromise O
additional O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
. O

APT38 S-APT
also O
targeted O
financial B-IDTY
transaction I-IDTY
exchange I-IDTY
companies E-IDTY
likely O
because O
of O
their O
proximity O
to O
banks S-IDTY
. O

Given O
the O
lapse O
in O
time O
between O
the O
spear-phishing S-ACT
and O
the O
heist B-ACT
activity E-ACT
in O
the O
above O
example O
, O
we O
suggest O
two O
separate O
but O
related O
groups S-APT
under O
the O
North B-LOC
Korean E-LOC
regime O
were O
responsible O
for O
carrying O
out O
missions O
; O
one O
associated O
with O
reconnaissance O
( O
TEMP.Hermit S-APT
or O
a O
related O
group O
) O
and O
another O
for O
the O
heists O
( O
APT38 S-APT
) O
. O

APT38 S-APT
, O
in O
particular O
, O
is O
strongly O
distinguishable O
because O
of O
its O
specific O
focus O
on O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
and O
operations O
that O
attempt O
to O
use O
SWIFT S-MAL
fraud O
to O
steal O
millions O
of O
dollars O
at O
a O
time O
. O

We O
can O
confirm O
that O
the O
APT38 B-ACT
operator I-ACT
activity E-ACT
is O
linked O
to O
the O
North B-LOC
Korean E-LOC
regime O
, O
but O
maintains O
a O
set O
of O
common O
characteristics O
, O
including O
motivation O
, O

and O
TTPs O
that O
set O
it O
apart O
from O
other O
statesponsored O
operations O
. O

As O
previously O

, O
we O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
APT38 S-APT

mission O
is O
focused O

the O

In O
all O
of O
these O

the O
Lazarus S-APT
utilized O
similar O
toolsets O
, O
including O
KillDisk S-MAL
that O
was O
executed O
on O

We O
are O
confident O
this O
KillDisk S-MAL
malware S-MAL
was O
deployed O
by O
Lazarus S-APT
, O
rather O
than O
by O
another O
, O
unrelated O
attacker S-APT

This O
recent O
attack O
against O
an O
online O

Central B-LOC

suggests O
that O
hacking O
tools O
from O
the O

are O
recompiled O
with O
every O
attack O
( O
we O
didn't O
see O
these O
exact O
samples O
anywhere O
else O
) O
. O

Utilizing O
KillDisk S-MAL
in O
the O
attack O
scenario O
most O
likely O
served O
one O
of O
two O
purposes O
: O
the O
attackers S-APT
covering O
their O
tracks O
after O
an O
espionage O
operation O
, O
or O
it O
was O
used O
directly O
for O
extortion O
or O
cyber-sabotage S-APT
. O

Today O
we'd O
like O
to O
share O
some O
of O
our O
findings O
, O
and O
add O
something O
new O
to O
what O
's O
currently O
common O
knowledge O
about O
Lazarus B-ACT
Group I-ACT
activities E-ACT
, O
and O
their O
connection O
to O
the O
much O
talked O
about O
February B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
incident O
, O
when O
an O
unknown O
attacker S-APT
attempted O
to O
steal O
up O
to O
$851M O
USD O
from O
Bangladesh B-IDTY
Central I-IDTY
Bank E-IDTY
. O

Since O
the O
Bangladesh S-LOC
incident O
there O
have O
been O
just O
a O
few O
articles O
explaining O
the O
connection O
between O
Lazarus B-APT
Group E-APT
and O
the O
Bangladesh S-LOC
bank S-IDTY
heist O
. O

However O
, O
from O
this O
it O
's O
only O
clear O
that O
Lazarus S-APT
might O
have O
attacked O
Polish O
banks S-IDTY
. O

Symantec S-SECTEAM
also O
confirmed O
seeing O
the O
Lazarus S-APT
wiper O
tool O
in O
Poland S-LOC
at O
one O
of O
their O
customers S-IDTY
. O

Considering O
that O
the O
afterhack O
publications O
by O
the O
media S-IDTY
mentioned O
that O
the O
investigation O
stumbled O
upon O
three O
different O
attackers S-APT
, O
it O
was O
not O
obvious O
whether O
Lazarus S-APT
was O
the O
one O
responsible O
for O
the O
fraudulent O
SWIFT O
transactions O
, O
or O
if O
Lazarus S-APT
had O
in O
fact O
developed O
its O
own O
malware O
to O
attack O
banks S-IDTY
' O
systems O
. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
add O
some O
strong O
facts O
that O
link O
some O
attacks O
on O
banks S-IDTY
to O
Lazarus S-APT
, O
and O
share O
some O
of O
our O
own O
findings O
as O
well O
as O
shed O
some O
light O
on O
the O
recent O
TTPs O
used O
by O
the O
attacker S-APT
, O
including O
some O
yet O
unpublished O
details O
from O
the O
attack O
in O
Europe S-LOC
in O
2017 S-TIME
. O

Lazarus B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
are O
not O
a O
local O
problem O
and O
clearly O
the O
group O
's O
operations O
span O
across O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

Lazarus S-APT
was O
previously O
known O
to O
conduct O
cyberespionage B-ACT
and I-ACT
cybersabotage I-ACT
activities E-ACT
, O
such O
as O
attacks O
on O
Sony B-IDTY
Pictures I-IDTY
Entertainment E-IDTY
with O
volumes O
of O
internal O
data O
leaked O
, O
and O
many O
system O
harddrives O
in O
the O
company O
wiped O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-APT
Group E-APT
is O
very O
large O
and O
works O
mainly O
on O
infiltration O
and O
espionage B-ACT
operations E-ACT
, O
while O
a O
substantially O
smaller O
units O
within O
the O
group O
, O
which O
we O
have O
dubbed O
Bluenoroff S-APT
, O
is O
responsible O
for O
financial O
profit O
. O

Lazarus S-APT
regrouped O
and O
rushed O
into O
new O
countries O
, O
selecting O
mostly O
poorer O
and O
less O
developed O
locations O
, O
hitting O
smaller O
banks S-IDTY
because O
they O
are O
, O
apparently O
, O
easy O
prey O
. O

To O
date O
, O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
group E-APT
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
most O
successful O
in O
launching O
large O
scale O
operations O
against O
the O
financial B-IDTY
industry E-IDTY
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus S-APT
will O
remain O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
threats O
to O
the O
banking B-IDTY
sector E-IDTY
, O
finance S-IDTY
, O
and O
trading B-IDTY
companies E-IDTY
, O
as O
well O
as O
casinos S-IDTY
for O
the O
next O
few O
years O
. O

We O
believe O
Lazarus S-APT
started O
this O
watering B-ACT
hole I-ACT
attack E-ACT
at O
the O
end B-TIME
of I-TIME
2016 E-TIME
after O
their O
other O
operation O
was O
interrupted O
in O
South B-LOC
East I-LOC
Asia E-LOC
. O

We O
believe O
they O
started O
this O
watering B-ACT
hole I-ACT
campaign E-ACT
at O
the O
end B-TIME
of I-TIME

after O
their O
other O

South B-LOC
East I-LOC

. O

A O
rudimentary O
but O
somewhat O
clever O
design O
, O
KiloAlfa S-MAL
provides O
keylogging O
capability O
for O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group E-APT
's O
collection O
of O
malicious O
tools O
. O

The O
design O
of O
KiloAlfa S-MAL
is O
broken O
down O
into O
two O
basic O
components O
: O
the O
persistence O
functionality O
and O
the O
keylogging B-MAL
functionality E-MAL
. O

The O
persistence O
functionality O
of O
KiloAlfa S-MAL
allows O
the O
malware O
to O
self-install O
on O
a O
victim O
's O
machine O
when O
activated O
( O
described O
below O
) O
. O

Evidence O
suggest O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group E-APT
uses O
compromised B-MAL
infrastructure E-MAL
as O
the O
public-facing O
touchpoint O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
their O
malware O
samples O
. O

PapaAlfa S-MAL
is O
believed O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
proxy O
malware O
components O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group E-APT
uses O
to O
hide O
the O
true O
command O
and O
control O
server O
for O
operations O
. O

Rather O
, O
PapaAlfa S-MAL
could O
be O
considered O
a O
smart O
proxy O
due O
in O
part O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Lazarus S-APT
can O
easily O
switch O
the O
backend O
destination O
address O
and O
PROT O
without O
having O
to O
reestablish O
control O
over O
the O
infected O
machine O
hosting O
the O
PapaAlfa S-MAL
malware S-MAL
. O

In O
terms O
of O
form O
factor O
, O
PapaAlfa S-MAL
comes O
in O
two O
flavors O
: O
service B-MAL
DLL E-MAL
and O
standalone B-MAL
executable E-MAL
. O

The O
IndiaBravo-PapaAlfa B-MAL
installer E-MAL
is O
responsible O
for O
installing O
the O
service O
DLL S-TOOL
variant O
. O

While O
the O
tools O
profiled O
in O
this O
report O
are O
not O
inherently O
malicious O
, O
their O
capabilities O
are O
nonetheless O
integral O
to O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group E-APT
's O
cyber O
operations O
, O
both O
espionage S-ACT
and O
destructive O
in O
nature O
, O
making O
them O
inherently O
dangerous O
to O
potential O
victims O
. O

These O
tools O
often O
lay O
the O
groundwork O
for O
further O
malicious B-ACT
activity E-ACT
, O
such O
as O
the O
targeting O
of O
antivirus O
capabilities O
and O
the O
disabling O
of O
firewalls O
, O
both O
of O
which O
are O
very O
fundamental O
defensive O
measures O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
like O
many O
other O
identified O
Lazarus B-APT
Group E-APT
families O
, O
these O
tools O
showcase O
the O
group O
's O
creative O
solutions O
, O
such O
as O
the O
PapaAlfa S-MAL
, O
which O
makes O
it O
difficult O
to O
immediately O
identify O
potentially O
malicious B-ACT
activity E-ACT
on O

the O
new O

The O

not O

by O

we O
assume O
that O
the O
author O
of O
the O

forgot O
to O
remove O
the O

the O
Russia S-LOC
decoy O

. O

The O
malware O
author O
changed O
the O
malware O
architecture O
, O
this O
version O
is O
divided O
in O
two O
binaries: O
conhote.dll S-FILE
, O
winnit.exe S-FILE
. O

Another O
difference O
is O
the O
directory O
where O
the O

are O
dropped O
, O
it's O
no O
longer O
C:\Windows S-FILE
but O
rather O
the O

As O
you O
can O
see O
the O

went O

great O

This O
is O
of O

simple O
but O
often O
it O
can O
be O
enough O
for O
a O
user O
to O
miss O

As O
in O
the O

the O

In O

the O

published O
a O

about O
a O
cyber B-ACT
espionage I-ACT
attack E-ACT
using O
the O
Emissary B-MAL
Trojan E-MAL
as O
a O
payload O
. O

The O
oldest O
sample O
we O
found O
was O
created O
in O
2009 S-TIME
, O
indicating O
this O
tool O
has O
been O
in O
use O
for O
almost O
seven O
years O

Emissary S-MAL

all O
of O
the O

and O
they O
use O
themes O
related O
to O
the O
government S-IDTY
or O

. O

Of O
note O
, O
this O
is O
three O
years O
earlier O
than O
the O
oldest O
Elise B-MAL

we O
have O
found O
, O
suggesting O
this O

we O
observed O
a O
TTP O
shift O
post O

with O

to O

; O
they O
started O
using O

All O
of O
the O

which O
is O
used O
primarily O
in O
Taiwan S-LOC
and O
Hong B-LOC

One O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
observations O
made O
during O
this O
analysis O
is O
that O
the O
amount O
of O
development O
effort O
devoted O
to O
Emissary S-MAL
significantly O
increased O
after O
we O
published O
our O
Operation B-ACT

, O

Our O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
malware O
authors O
created O
Emissary S-MAL
as O
early O
as O
2009 S-TIME
, O
which O
suggests O
that O
threat O
actors S-APT
have O
relied O
on O
this O
tool O
as O
a O
payload O
in O
cyber-espionage B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
for O
many O
years O
. O

While O
it O
lacks O
more O
advanced O
functionality O
like O
screen O

, O
it O
is O
still O
able O
to O
carry O
out O
most O
tasks O
desired O
by O

a O
much O
more O

in O

Version O

received O
one O

in O
October B-TIME
2013 E-TIME
before O

the O

that O
the O

that O
this O

detail O
the O
most O

including O
the O
sustained O
targeting O
of O
MSPs S-IDTY

which O
we O
have O
named O
Operation B-ACT

the O
targeting O
of O
a O
number O
of O
Japanese S-LOC

therefore O
represent O
a O
high-payoff O
target O
for O

Given O
the O

MSPs S-IDTY
have O
, O
once O
APT10 S-APT
has O
gained O
access O
to O
a O
MSP S-MAL

it O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
relatively O
straightforward O
to O
exploit S-VULNAME
this O

move O
laterally O
onto O
the O
networks O
of O
potentially O
thousands O

provide O
access O

) O
post-2014 S-TIME
, O
following O
its O
shift O
from O
Poison B-MAL
Ivy E-MAL
to O
PlugX S-MAL
. O

We O
have O
observed O
that O
in O
cases O
where O
APT10 S-APT
has O
infiltrated O
a O
target O
via O
an O
MSP S-MAL
, O
it O
continues O
to O
use O
the O
MSPs S-IDTY
credentials O
. O

In O
order O
to O
gain O
any O
further O
credentials O
, O
APT10 S-APT
will O
usually O
deploy O
credential O
theft O
tools O
such O
as O
mimikatz S-MAL
or O
PwDump S-MAL
, O
sometimes O
using O
DLL B-MAL
load I-MAL
order I-MAL
hijacking E-MAL
, O
to O
use O
against O
a O
domain O
controller O
, O
explained O
further O
in O
Annex O
B O
. O

APT10 S-APT
achieves O
persistence O
on O
its O
targets O
primarily O
by O
using O
scheduled B-MAL
tasks E-MAL
or O
Windows B-MAL
services E-MAL
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
the O
malware O
remains O
active O
regardless O
of O
system O
reboots O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
compromising O
high O
value O
domain O
controllers O
and O
security O
servers O
, O
the O
threat O
actor O
has O
also O
been O
observed O
identifying O
and O
subsequently O
installing O
malware O
on O
low O
profile O
systems O
that O
provide O
non-critical O
support O
functions O
to O
the O
business O
, O
and O
are O
thus O
less O
likely O
to O
draw O
the O
attention O
of O
system O
administrators O
. O

In O
the O
majority O
of O
instances O
APT10 S-APT
used O
either O
a O
reverse B-MAL
shell E-MAL
or O
RDP S-MAL
connection O
to O
install O
its O
malware O
; O
the O
actor S-APT
also O
uses O
these O
methods O
to O
propagate O
across O
the O
network O
. O

The O
tactical O
malware O
, O
historically O
EvilGrab S-MAL
, O
and O
now O
ChChes S-MAL
( O
and O
likely O
also O
RedLeaves S-MAL
) O
, O
is O
designed O
to O
be O
lightweight O
and O
disposable O
, O
often O
being O
delivered O
through O
spear B-ACT
phishing E-ACT
. O

Once O
executed O
, O
tactical O
malware O
contains O
the O
capability O
to O
profile O
the O
network S-IDTY
and O
manoeuvre O
through O
it O
to O
identify O
a O
key O
system O
of O
interest O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
APT10 S-APT
use O
DLL B-ACT
search I-ACT
order I-ACT
hijacking I-ACT
and I-ACT
sideloading E-ACT
, O
to O
execute O
some O
modified O
versions O
of O
open-source O
tools O
. O

For O
example O
, O
PwC B-SECTEAM
UK E-SECTEAM
has O
observed O
APT10 S-APT
compiling O
DLLs O
out O
of O

, O
such O

, O
and O
using O
legitimate O
, O

, O
such O
as O

. O

During O
our O

, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
observe O
APT10 S-APT
once O
again O
initiate O
a O
retooling O

in O
late B-TIME

We O
observed O
the O

In O
2012 S-TIME
, O
the O

popular O
with O

But O
the O

has O
also O
used O
Poison B-MAL
Ivy E-MAL

PIVY S-MAL

, O
a O

more O
commonly O
associated O
with O
threat O
actors S-APT
in O
China S-LOC
— O
so O
much O
so O
that O
PIVY S-MAL
has O
, O
inaccurately O
, O
become O
synonymous O
with O
all O
APT B-ACT

linked O
to O
China S-LOC

This O
blog O

deployed O
PIVY S-MAL
against O

in O
the O
U.S. S-LOC
We O
also O
examine O
additional O
PIVY B-ACT

leverage O
Arabic-language O

We O
do O
not O

the O
Molerats B-ACT

we O
were O
somewhat O

the O

When O
we O

May B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
, O
we O
believed O
at O
the O

it O
was O
a O
unique O
attack B-ACT
campaign E-ACT
likely O
operated O
by O
a O
known O

was O
delivered O

that O
exploited O
CVE-2017-0199 S-VULID

In O
July B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
, O
we O
observed O
the O
OilRig B-APT

using O
a O
tool O
they O
developed O
called O
ISMAgent S-MAL
in O
a O
new O

In O
August B-TIME

another O

On O

Based O
on O
that O
research O
and O
this O
observation O
, O
we O
postulate O
that O
the O
OilRig B-APT
group E-APT
gathered O
credentials O
to O
a O
legitimate O
user O

and O
logged O

The O

Kaspersky B-SECTEAM

this O

It O
is O
not O
a O

tactic O
for O
Turla S-APT
to O
rely O
on O
fake B-MAL

try O
to O
trick O
the O

could O
use O

to O
perform O
a O
local O

Our O
January B-TIME
2018 E-TIME
white O
paper O
was O
the O
first O
public O
analysis O
of O
a O
Turla B-ACT
campaign E-ACT
called O
Mosquito S-ACT
. O

It O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Turla S-APT
has O
used O
generic B-MAL
tools E-MAL
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
we O
have O
seen O
the O
group O
using O
open-source B-MAL
password I-MAL
dumpers E-MAL
such O
as O
Mimikatz S-MAL
. O

Starting O
in O
March B-TIME
2018 E-TIME
, O
we O
observed O
a O
significant O
change O
in O
the O
campaign O
: O
it O
now O
leverages O
the O
open O
source O
exploitation O
framework O
Metasploit S-MAL
before O
dropping O
the O
custom O
Mosquito O
backdoor O
. O

Even O
an O
experienced O
user O
can O
be O
fooled O
by O
downloading O
a O
malicious B-FILE
file E-FILE
that O
is O
apparently O
from O
adobe.com S-ACT
, O
since O
the O
URL O
and O
the O
IP S-PROT
address O
correspond O
to O
Adobe O
's O
legitimate O
infrastructure O
. O

However O
, O
to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
Turla S-APT
has O
used O
Metasploit S-MAL
as O
a O
first O
stage O
backdoor O
, O
instead O
of O
relying O
on O
one O
of O
its O
own O
tools O
such O
as O
Skipper S-MAL
. O

Traffic O
was O
intercepted O
on O
a O
node O
between O
the O
end O
machine O
and O
the O
Adobe O
servers O
, O
allowing O
Turla S-APT
's O
operators O
to O
replace B-ACT
the I-ACT
legitimate I-ACT
Flash I-ACT
executable E-ACT
with O
a O
trojanized O
version O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
March B-TIME
2018 E-TIME
, O
as O
part O
of O
our O
regular O
tracking O
of O
Turla S-APT
's O
activities S-ACT
, O
we O
observed O
some O
changes O
in O
the O
Mosquito B-ACT
campaign E-ACT
. O

In O
this O
post O
, O
we O
have O
presented O
the O
evolutions O
of O
the O
Turla B-ACT
Mosquito I-ACT
campaign E-ACT
over O
the O
last O
few O
months O
. O

Primary O
targets O
for O
this O
adversary O
are O
in O
the O
government S-IDTY
, O
aerospace S-IDTY
, O
NGO S-IDTY
, O
defense S-IDTY
, O
cryptology S-IDTY
and O
education B-IDTY
sectors E-IDTY
. O

Turla S-APT
's O
campaign O
still O
relies O
on O
a O
fake O
Flash S-TOOL
installer O
but O
, O
instead O
of O
directly O
dropping O
the O
two O
malicious O
DLLs O
, O
it O
executes O
a O
Metasploit B-MAL
shellcode I-MAL
and I-MAL
drops E-MAL
, O
or O
downloads O
from O
Google O
Drive O
, O
a O
legitimate O
Flash S-TOOL
installer O
. O

The O
Turla S-APT
espionage O
group O
has O
been O
targeting O
various O
institutions O
for O
many O
years O
. O

Recently O
, O
we O
found O
several O
new O
versions O
of O
Carbon S-MAL
, O
a O
second O
stage O
backdoor O
in O
the O
Turla S-APT
group O
arsenal O
. O

The O
Turla S-APT
group O
is O
known O
to O
be O
painstaking O
and O
work O
in O
stages O
, O
first O
doing O
reconnaissance O
on O
their O
victims' O
systems O
before O
deploying O
their O
most O
sophisticated O
tools O
such O
as O
Carbon S-MAL
. O

Kaspersky B-SECTEAM

Reporting I-SECTEAM

, O
customers O
received O
an O
update O
in O
mid-February S-TIME
2017 S-TIME
. O

Like O
previous O
Turla B-ACT
activity E-ACT
, O
WhiteBear S-MAL
leverages O
compromised B-ACT
websites E-ACT
and O
hijacked O
satellite O
connections O
for O
command O
and O
control O
( O
C2 S-TOOL
) O
infrastructure O
. O

WhiteBear S-MAL
is O
a O
parallel O
project O
or O
second O
stage O
of O
the O
Skipper B-MAL
Turla E-MAL
cluster O
of O
activity O
documented O
in O
another O
private O
intelligence O
report O
" O
Skipper B-MAL
Turla E-MAL
– O
the O
White B-MAL
Atlas E-MAL
framework O
" O
from O
mid-2016 S-TIME
. O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
similarities O
to O
previous O
Turla B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
, O
we O
believe O
that O
WhiteBear S-MAL
is O
a O
distinct O
project O
with O
a O
separate O
focus O
. O

From O
February S-TIME
to O
September B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
, O
WhiteBear B-ACT
activity E-ACT
was O
narrowly O
focused O
on O
embassies S-IDTY
and O
consular O
operations O
around O
the O
world O
. O

Continued O
WhiteBear B-ACT
activity E-ACT
later O
shifted O
to O
include O
defense-related B-IDTY
organizations E-IDTY
into O
June B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
. O

All O
of O
these O
early O
WhiteBear S-MAL
targets O
were O
related O
to O
embassies S-IDTY
and O
diplomatic/foreign O
affair O
organizations O
. O

Thus O
, O
Turla S-APT
operators O
had O
access O
to O
some O
highly O
sensitive O
information O
( O
such O
as O
emails S-TOOL
sent O
by O
the O
German B-IDTY
Foreign I-IDTY
Office I-IDTY
staff E-IDTY
) O
for O
almost O
a O
year O
. O

Our O
investigation O
also O
led O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
dozens O
of O
email S-TOOL
addresses O
registered O
by O
Turla S-APT
operators O
for O
this O
campaign O
and O
used O
to O
receive O
exfiltrated O
data O
from O
the O
victims O
. O

It O
mainly O
targets O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Outlook S-TOOL
, O
a O
widely O
used O
mail O
client O
, O
but O
also O
targets O
The O
Bat! O
, O
a O
mail O
client O
very O
popular O
in O
Eastern O
Europe O
. O

First O
, O
Turla S-APT
steals O
emails S-TOOL
by O
forwarding O
all O
outgoing O
emails S-TOOL
to O
the O
attackers O
. O

We O
identified O
several O
European B-IDTY
governments E-IDTY
and O
defense B-IDTY
companies E-IDTY
compromised O
with O
this O
group O
. O

What O
actually O
happens O
is O
that O
the O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
decode O
data O
from O
the O
PDF B-MAL
documents E-MAL
and O
interpret O
it O
as O
commands O
for O
the O
backdoor O
. O

In O
early O
2018 S-TIME
, O
multiple O
media S-IDTY
claimed O
that O
Turla S-APT
operators O
used O
mail B-ACT
attachments E-ACT
to O
control O
infected O
machines O
. O

As O
detailed O
in O
the O
previous O
section O
, O
this O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
manipulate O
and O
exfiltrate O
emails S-TOOL
. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
Turla S-APT
is O
the O
only O
espionage O
group O
that O
currently O
uses O
a O
backdoor O
entirely O
controlled O
by O
emails S-TOOL
, O
and O
more O
specifically O
via O
PDF B-MAL
attachments E-MAL
. O

The O
attackers O
first O
infected O
in O
March B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
. O

Our O
research O
shows O
that O
compromised O
organizations O
are O
at O
risk O
of O
not O
only O
being O
spied O
on O
by O
the O
Turla S-APT
group O
who O
planted O
the O
backdoor O
, O
but O
also O
by O
other O
attackers O
. O

The O
developers O
refer O
to O
this O
tool O
by O
the O
name O
Kazuar S-MAL
, O
which O
is O
a O
Trojan S-MAL
written O
using O
the O
Microsoft.NET O
Framework O
that O
offers O
actors O
complete O
access O
to O
compromised O
systems O
targeted O
by O
its O
operator O
. O

We O
suspect O
the O
Kazuar B-MAL
tool E-MAL
may O
be O
linked O
to O
the O
Turla S-APT
threat O
actor O
group O
( O
also O
known O
as O
Uroburos S-APT
and O
Snake S-APT
) O
, O
who O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
have O
compromised O
embassies S-IDTY
, O
defense B-IDTY
contractors E-IDTY
, O
educational B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
, O
and O
research B-IDTY
organizations E-IDTY
across O
the O
globe O
. O

This O
is O
also O
a O
full-featured B-MAL
backdoor E-MAL
controlled O
by O
email S-ACT
, O
and O
which O
can O
work O
independently O
of O
any O
other O
Turla S-APT
component O
. O

A O
hallmark O
of O
Turla S-APT
operations O
is O
iterations O
of O
their O
tools O
and O
code B-ACT
lineage E-ACT
in O
Kazuar S-MAL
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
at O
least O
2005 S-TIME
. O

If O
the O
hypothesis O
is O
correct O
and O
the O
Turla S-APT
threat O
group O
is O
using O
Kazuar S-MAL
, O
we O
believe O
they O
may O
be O
using O
it O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
Carbon S-MAL
and O
its O
derivatives O
. O

We O
used O
a O
combination O
of O
tools O
such O
as O
NoFuserEx S-MAL
, O
ConfuserEx B-MAL
Fixer E-MAL
, O
ConfuserEx B-MAL
Switch I-MAL
Killer E-MAL
, O
and O
de4d0t S-MAL
in O
order O
to O
deobfuscate O
the O
code O
for O
in O
depth O
analysis O
. O

Kazuar S-SECTEAM
generates O
its O
mutex O
by O
using O
a O
process O
that O
begins O
with O
obtaining O
the O
MD5 S-ENCR
hash O
of O
a O
string O
" O
[username]=>singleton-instance-mutex O
" O
. O

The O
subject O
is O
a O
series O
of O
targeted B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
against O
private B-IDTY
companies E-IDTY
. O

e O
uncovered O
the O
activity O
of O
a O
hacking O
group O
which O
has O
Chinese O
origins O
. O

Also O
, O
by O
creating O
this O
type O
of O
API B-ACT
access E-ACT
, O
Turla S-APT
could O
use O
one O
accessible O
server O
as O
a O
single O
point O
to O
dump O
data O
to O
and O
exfiltrate O
data O
from O
. O

According O
to O
our O
estimations O
, O
this O
group O
has O
been O
active O
for O
several O
years O
and O
specializes O
in O
cyberattacks O
against O
the O
online B-IDTY
video I-IDTY
game I-IDTY
industry E-IDTY
. O

Based O
on O
our O
analysis O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
threat O
actors O
may O
compile O
Windows S-OS
and O
Unix O
based O
payloads O
using O
the O
same O
code O
to O
deploy O
Kazuar S-SECTEAM
against O
both O
platforms O
. O

The O
group O

objective O
is O
to O

APT5 S-APT

2007 S-TIME

APT5 S-APT
has O
targeted O
or O
breached O
organizations O
across O
multiple O
industries O
, O
but O
its O
focus O
appears O
to O
be O
on O
telecommunications S-IDTY
and O
technology B-IDTY
companies E-IDTY
, O
especially O
information O
about O

APT5 S-APT

firm E-IDTY
that O
sells O

for O
both O
industrial S-IDTY

In O

, O
APT5 O
breached O
the O
network O
of O
an O
international B-IDTY
telecommunications I-IDTY

The O
group O
used O

the O

The O

an O

In O

which O
tend O
to O
rely O
heavily O

While O
we O
were O
unable O

recover O
the O

it O
is O

However O
, O
to O

use O
zero-day S-VULNAME

so O
even O

Our O
direct O
observation O
of O
in-the-wild O
spearphishing B-ACT

staged O
by O
the O
Bahamut O

have O
been O
solely O
attempts O

deceive O

into O
providing O

through O
impersonation O
of O

from O

Bahamut O
was O
first O
noticed O
when O
it O
targeted O
a O
Middle B-IDTY

human I-IDTY

activist E-IDTY
in O
the O
first O
week O
of O
January B-TIME
2017 E-TIME

Later O
that O
month O
, O
the O
same O
tactics O
and O
patterns O
were O
seen O
in O
attempts O
against O
an O
Iranian B-IDTY
women I-IDTY
's I-IDTY
activist E-IDTY
– O
an O
individual S-IDTY
commonly O
targeted O
by O
Iranian B-LOC

, O
such O
as O
Charming O

and O
the O

campaign E-ACT
documented O

In O
June S-TIME
we O
published O
on O
a O
previously O
unknown O
group O
we O
named O
" O
Bahamut S-APT
" O
, O
a O
strange O
campaign O
of O

malware O
apparently O
focused O
on O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East E-LOC

South B-LOC

Once O
inside O
a O
network O
, O
APT40 S-APT
uses O
credential-harvesting B-MAL
tools E-MAL
to O
gain O
usernames O
and O

, O
allowing O
it O
to O
expand O
its O
reach O
across O

and O
move O
laterally O
through O
an O
environment O
as O
it O
moves O
to O
towards O
the O
ultimate O
goal O
of O
stealing O
data O
. O

Bahamut S-APT
was O
shown O
to O
be O
resourceful O
, O
not O
only O
maintaining O
their O
own O
Android S-OS
malware S-MAL
but O
running O
propaganda O
sites O
, O
although O
the O
quality O
of O
these O
activities S-ACT
varied O
noticeably O
. O

In O
June S-TIME
we O
published O
on O
a O
previously O
unknown O
group O
we O
named O
" O
Bahamut S-APT
" O
, O
a O
strange O
campaign O
of O

apparently O
focused O
on O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East E-LOC

Several O
times O
, O
APT5 S-APT
has O
targeted O
organizations S-IDTY
and O
personnel S-IDTY
based O
in O
Southeast B-LOC
Asia E-LOC
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
same O
week O
of O
September O
a O
series O
of O
spearphishing S-ACT
attempts O
once O
again O
targeted O
a O
set O
of O
otherwise O
unrelated O
individuals O
, O
employing O
the O
same O
tactics O
as O
before O
. O

Our O
primary O
contribution O
in O
this O
update O
is O
to O
implicate O
Bahamut O
in O
what O
are O
likely O
counterterrorism-motivated O
surveillance O
operations O
, O
and O
to O
further O
affirm O
our O
belief O
that O
the O
group O
is O
a O
hacker-for-hire O
operation O
. O

As O
we O
wrote O
then O
, O
compared O
to O
Kingphish O
, O
Bahamut O
operates O
as O
though O
it O
were O
a O
generation O
ahead O
in O
terms O
of O
professionalism O
and O
ambition O
. O

In O
the O
Bahamut O
report O
, O
we O
discussed O
two O
domains S-MAL
found O
within O
our O
search O
that O
were O
linked O
with O
a O
custom B-MAL
Android I-MAL
malware I-MAL
agent E-MAL
. O

After O
the O
publication O
of O
the O
original O
report O
, O
these O
sites O
were O
taken O
offline O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
one O

was O
even O
updated O
a O
six O
days O
prior O
to O
our O

( O
the O

FIF O

notable O
for O
its O

, O
which O
has O
committed O

in O
support O
of O
establishing O
Pakistani O
control O
over O
the O
disputed O

As O
a O
result O
, O
it O
is O
already O
flagged O
as O
Bahamut O
by O
antivirus O
engines O
. O

Our O
initial O
observation O
of O
the O
Bahamut O
group O
originated O
from O
in-the-wild O
attempts O
to O
deceive O
targets O
into O
providing O
account O
passwords O
through O
impersonation O
of O
platform B-IDTY
providers E-IDTY
. O

One O
curious O
trait O
of O
Bahamut O
is O
that O
it O
develops O
fully-functional O
applications O
in O
support O
of O
its O
espionage O
activities O
, O
rather O
than O
push O
nonfunctional O
fake O
apps O
or O
bundle O
malware O
with O
legitimate B-MAL
software E-MAL
. O

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut O
appears O
to O
track O
password O
attempts O
in O
response O
to O
failed O
phishing S-ACT
attempts O
or O
to O
provoke O
the O
target O
to O
provide O
more O
passwords O
. O

Bahamut O
spearphishing S-ACT
attempts O
have O
also O
been O
accompanied O
with O
SMS O
messages O
purporting O
to O
be O
from O
Google S-IDTY
about O

issues O
on O
their O
account O
, O
including O
a O
class O
0 O

or O

. O


These O
text O
messages O
did O
not O
include O

but O
are O
intended O
to O
build O
credibility O
around O
the O
fake O
service O
notifications O
later O
sent O
to O
the O
target O

We O
have O
not O
found O
evidence O
of O
Bahamut S-APT
engaging O
in O
crime O
or O
operating O
outside O
its O
limited O
geographic O
domains O
, O
although O
this O
narrow O
perspective O
could O
be O
accounted O
for O
by O
its O
compartmentalization O
of O
operations O
. O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut S-APT
's O
campaigns S-ACT
have O
appeared O
to O
be O
primarily O
espionage O
or O
information O
operations O
– O
not O
destructive B-ACT

or O
fraud O
. O

The O
targets O

themes O
of O
Bahamut O

have O
consistently O

Bookworm S-MAL
's O
functional O
code O
is O
radically O
different O
from O
PlugX S-MAL
and O
has O
a O
rather O
unique O
modular O
architecture O
that O
warranted O
additional O
analysis O
by O
Unit B-SECTEAM
42 E-SECTEAM
. O

Bookworm S-MAL
has O
little O
malicious O
functionality O
built-in O
, O
with O
its O
only O
core O
ability O
involving O
stealing O
keystrokes O
and O
clipboard O
contents O
. O

The O
Plead S-MAL
malware S-MAL
is O
a O
backdoor S-MAL
which O
, O
according O
to O
Trend B-SECTEAM
Micro E-SECTEAM
, O
is O
used O
by O
the O
BlackTech O
group O
in O
targeted B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
. O

So O
far O
, O
it O
appears O
threat O
actors O
have O
deployed O
the O
Bookworm B-MAL
Trojan E-MAL
primarily O
in O
attacks O
on O
targets O
in O
Thailand S-LOC
. O

The O
threat O
actors O
use O
a O
commercial O
installation O
tool O
called O
Smart B-MAL
Installer I-MAL
Maker E-MAL
to O
encapsulate O
and O
execute O
a O
self-extracting B-MAL
RAR E-MAL
archive O
and O
in O
some O
cases O
a O
decoy B-MAL
slideshow E-MAL
or O
Flash B-MAL
installation I-MAL
application E-MAL
. O

The O
self-extracting B-MAL
RAR E-MAL
writes O
a O
legitimate O

, O
an O
actor-created O
DLL S-TOOL
called O
Loader.dll S-FILE
and O
a O
file O
named O
readme.txt S-FILE
to O
the O
filesystem O
and O
then O
executes O
the O
legitimate O
executable O
. O

targeted B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
. O

Using O
XREFs S-MAL
during O
static O
analysis O
is O
a O
common O
technique O
to O
quickly O
find O
where O
functions O
of O
interest O
are O
called O
. O

The O
developers O
designed O
Bookworm S-MAL
to O
be O
a O
modular B-MAL
Trojan E-MAL
not O
limited O
to O
just O
the O
initial O
architecture O
of O
the O
Trojan S-MAL
, O
as O
Bookworm S-MAL
can O
also O
load O
additional O
modules O
provided O
by O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
. O

Although O
the O
developers O
of O
Bookworm S-MAL
have O
included O
only O
keylogging O
functionality O
in O
Bookworm S-MAL
as O
a O
core O
ability O
, O
as O
suggested O
in O
Table O
1 O
, O
several O
of O
the O
embedded O
DLLs O
provide O
Leader O
with O
cryptographic O
and O
hashing O
functions O
, O
while O
others O
support O
Leader S-MAL
's O
ability O
to O
communicate O
with O
its O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
. O

While O
we O
did O
not O
discuss O
the O
surrounding B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
using O
Bookworm S-MAL
in O
detail O
, O
we O
have O
observed O
threat O
actors O
deploying O
Bookworm S-MAL
primarily O
in O
attacks O
on O
targets O
in O
Thailand S-LOC
. O

Also O
, O
Bookworm S-MAL
uses O
a O
combination O
of O
encryption O
and O
compression O
algorithms O
to O
obfuscate O
the O
traffic O
between O
the O
system O
and O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
. O

The O
developers O
of O
Bookworm S-MAL
have O
gone O
to O
great O
lengths O
to O
create O
a O
modular O
framework O
that O
is O
very O
flexible O
through O
its O
ability O
to O
run O
additional O
modules O
directly O
from O
its O

Unit B-SECTEAM

recently O
published O
a O
blog O
on O
a O
newly O
identified O
Trojan S-MAL
called O
Bookworm S-MAL
, O
which O
discussed O
the O
architecture O
and O
capabilities O
of O
the O
malware O
and O
alluded O
to O
Thailand S-LOC
being O
the O
focus O
of O
the O
threat O
actors' O
campaigns S-ACT

Leader S-MAL
is O
Bookworm S-MAL
's O
main O
module O
and O
controls O
all O
of O
the O
activities S-ACT
of O
the O
Trojan S-MAL
, O
but O
relies O
on O
the O
additional O
DLLs S-FILE
to O
provide O
specific O
functionality O
. O

The O
developers O
of O
Bookworm S-MAL
use O
these O
modules O
in O
a O
rather O
unique O
ACT O
, O
as O
the O
other O
embedded O
DLLs O
provide O
API O
functions O
for O
Leader S-MAL
to O
carry O
out O
its O
tasks O
. O

Unit B-SECTEAM

does O
not O
have O
detailed O
targeting O
information O
for O
all O
known O
Bookworm B-MAL
samples E-MAL
, O
but O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
attempted O
attacks O
on O
at O
least O
two O
branches O
of O
government S-IDTY
in O
Thailand O
. O

We O
speculate O
that O
other O
attacks O
delivering O
Bookworm S-MAL
were O
also O
targeting O
organizations O
in O
Thailand S-LOC
based O
on O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
associated O
decoys B-FILE
documents E-FILE
, O
as O
well O
as O
several O
of O
the O
dynamic B-MAL
DNS I-MAL

names O
used O
to O
host O
C2 S-TOOL
servers O
that O
contain O
the O
words O
" O
Thai S-LOC
" O
or O
" O
Thailand S-LOC
" O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
likely O
threat O
actors O
will O
continue O
development O
Bookworm S-MAL
, O
and O
will O
continue O
to O
use O
it O
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

Threat O
actors O
have O
delivered O
Bookworm S-MAL
as O
a O
payload O
in O
attacks O
on O
targets O
in O
Thailand S-LOC
. O

Analysis O
of O
compromised O
systems O
seen O
communicating O
with O
Bookworm B-MAL
C2 I-MAL
servers E-MAL
also O
confirms O
our O
speculation O
on O
targeting O
with O
a O
majority O
of O
systems O
existing O
within O
Thailand S-LOC
. O

As O
mentioned O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Bookworm S-MAL
, O
the O
Trojan S-MAL
sends O
a O
static O
date O
string O
to O
the O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
that O
we O
referred O
to O
as O
a O
campaign O
code O
. O

We O
believed O
that O
the O
actors O
would O
use O
this O
date B-MAL
code E-MAL
to O
track O
their O
attack B-ACT
campaigns E-ACT
; O
however O
, O
after O
continued O
analysis O
of O
the O
malware O
, O
we O
think O
these O
static O
dates O
could O
also O
be O
a O
build O
identifier O
for O
the O
Trojan S-MAL
. O

Threat O
actors O
may O
use O
the O
date B-FILE
string I-FILE
hardcoded E-FILE
into O
each O
Bookworm B-MAL
sample E-MAL
as O
a O
build O
identifier O
. O

A O
Trojan S-MAL
sending O
a O
build O
identifier O
to O
its O
C2 S-TOOL
server O
is O
quite O
common O
, O
as O
it O
notifies O
the O
threat O
actors O
of O
the O
specific O
version O
of O
the O
Trojan S-MAL
in O
which O
they O
are O
interacting O
. O

Due O
to O
these O
changes O
without O
a O
new O
date B-FILE
string E-FILE
, O
we O
believe O
the O
date B-FILE
codes E-FILE
are O
used O
for O
campaign O
tracking O
rather O
than O
a O
Bookworm S-MAL
build O
identifier O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Bookworm B-MAL
samples E-MAL
use O
the O
static O
date O
string O
as O
campaign O
codes O
, O
which O
we O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
approximate O
date O
of O
each O
attack O
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
detailed O
targeting O
information O
. O

Another O

So O
far O
, O
Unit B-SECTEAM

has O
seen O

suggesting O
that O
the O
threat O
actors O
use O
these O

as O
the O

. O

The O

actors O
have O
continually O
used O
Flash B-MAL

The O
vast O
majority O
of O

communicating O
with O
Bookworm S-MAL
C2 S-TOOL

are O
within O
the O
Bangkok O
metropolitan O

where O
a O
majority O

the O
government S-IDTY

exists O
. O

Buhtrap S-APT
has O
been O
active O
since O
2014 S-TIME
, O
however O
their O
first O
attacks O
against O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
were O
only O
detected O
in O
August B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
group O
is O
known O
to O
target O
Russian O
and O
Ukrainian S-LOC
banks S-IDTY
. O

Buhtrap S-APT
is O
the O
first O
hacker O
group O
using O
a O
network B-ACT
worm E-ACT
to O
infect O
the O
overall O
bank S-IDTY
infrastructure O
that O
significantly O
increases O
the O
difficulty O
of O
removing O
all O
malicious O
functions O
from O
the O
network O
. O

Malicious O
programs O
intentionally O
scan O
for O
machines O
with O
an O
automated O
Bank-Customer O
system O
of O
the O
Central O
bank S-IDTY
of O
Russia S-LOC
( O
further O
referred O
to O
as O
BCS O
CBR O
) O
. O

If O
the O
document O
was O
delivered O
with O
macros O
instead O
of O
exploits O
( O
CVE-2012-0158 S-VULID
, O
CVE-2013-3906 S-VULID
or O
CVE-2014-1761 S-VULID
) O
, O
then O
the O
document O
contained O
instructions O
for O
enabling O
macros O
. O

We O
noticed O
that O
criminals O
were O
spreading O
Buhtrap S-APT
using O
this O
method O
from O
May B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
to O
August B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
attackers O
used O
the O
same O
compromised B-MAL
websites E-MAL
to O
spread O
Buhtrap S-MAL
as O
those O
that O
had O
been O
used O
for O
the O
Corkow B-MAL
Trojan E-MAL
. O

Moreover O
, O
they O
used O
the O
same O
exploit S-VULNAME
kit B-VULNAME
Niteris E-VULNAME
as O
that O
in O
the O
Corkow S-MAL
case O
. O

Purportedly O
during O
one O
of O
the O
first O
attacks O
hackers O
intercepted O
the O
mailing O
list O
of O
the O
Anti-drop O
" O
club O
and O
created O
a O
specific O
phishing B-ACT
email E-ACT
for O
its O
members O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
still O
widely O
used O
, O
notably O
in O
Russia S-LOC
. O

As O
noted O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Buhtrap O
, O
this O
gang O
has O
been O
actively O
targeting O
Russian O
businesses S-IDTY
, O
mostly O
through O
spear-phishing S-ACT
. O

It O
is O
thus O
interesting O
to O
see O
Buhtrap O
add O
strategic B-ACT
web I-ACT
compromises E-ACT
to O
their O
arsenal O
. O

The O
first O
malware O
we O
saw O
was O
the O
lurk B-MAL
downloader E-MAL
, O
which O
was O
distributed O
on O
October B-TIME
26th E-TIME
. O

The O
executable O
would O
install O
the O
real O
Ammyy O
product O
, O
but O
would O
also O
launch O
a O
file O
called O
either O
AmmyyService.exe S-FILE
or O
AmmyySvc.exe S-FILE
which O
contained O
the O
malicious O
payload O
. O

Buhtrap S-APT
is O
getting O
better O
at O
disguising O
the O
code O
they O
inject O
into O
compromised B-MAL
websites E-MAL
. O

With O
the O
recent O
arrests O
of O
actors O
using O
the O
Lurk B-MAL
banking I-MAL
trojan E-MAL
, O
Buhtrap O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
likely O
alternative O
for O
actors O
wishing O
to O
target O
Russian S-LOC
banks S-IDTY
and O
software O
. O

They O
have O
different O
functions O
and O
ACTs O
of O
spreading O
, O
but O
the O
same O
purpose O
— O
to O
steal O
money O
from O
the O
accounts O
of O
businesses S-IDTY
. O

Our O
experts O
have O
found O
that O
cybercriminals O
are O
actively O
focusing O
on O
SMBs S-MAL
, O
and O
giving O
particular O
attention O
to O
accountants S-IDTY
. O

The O
first O
encounter O
with O
Buhtrap O
was O
registered O
back O
in O
2014 S-TIME
. O

For O
now O
, O
we O
can O
call O
RTM S-MAL
one O
of O
the O
most O
active O
financial S-IDTY
Trojans O
. O

At O
that O
time O
it O
was O
the O
name O
of O
a O
cybercriminal O
group O
that O
was O
stealing O
money O
from O
Russian S-LOC
financial B-IDTY
establishments E-IDTY
— O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
at O
least O
$150,000 O
per O
hit O
. O

Buhtrap O
resurfaced O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
2017 S-TIME
in O
the O
TwoBee B-ACT
campaign E-ACT
, O
where O
it O
served O
primarily O
as O
means O
of O
malware O
delivery O
. O

After O
the O
source O
codes O
of O
their O
tools O
became O

Just O
like O
last O
time O
, O
Buhtrap O
is O
spreading O
through O
exploits O
embedded O
in O
news B-IDTY
outlets E-IDTY

Estimating O
the O

is O
challenging O
, O
but O
as O
we O
learned O
, O
the O
criminals O
are O
siphoning O
off O

that O
do O
not O
exceed O
$15,000 O

As O
explained O
later O
, O
we O
believe O
this O
campaign O
is O
financially-motivated O
and O
that O
it O
targets O
accounting B-IDTY
departments E-IDTY
in O
Russian O

. O

" O
Buhgalter O

Seeing O
a O

like O
this O
, O
inevitably O
the O
Anunak/Carbanak S-MAL
documented O
by O
Fox-IT S-SECTEAM
and O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
comes O
to O
mind O
. O

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
similar O
, O
it O
uses O
a O
similar O
modified O
mimikatz S-MAL

, O
and O
it O
uses O
a O
third-party B-MAL

Sometimes O

the O

use O

an O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
attackers O
attracted O
our O
attention O
by O
attempting O

We O
initially O
became O

observed O

by O

of O
several O

we O
have O
affiliated O
with O
the O

has O
moved O

Clever B-APT
Kitten E-APT
actors O
have O
a O
strong O
affinity O
for O
PHP O
server-side O
attacks O
to O
make O
access O
; O
this O
is O
relatively O
unique O
amongst O
targeted O
attackers O
who O
often O
favor O
targeting O
a O
specific O
individual S-IDTY
at O
a O
specific O
organization O
using O
social B-IDTY
engineering E-IDTY
. O

Clever B-APT
Kitten E-APT
primarily O
targets O
global O
companies O
with O
strategic O
importance O
to O
countries O
that O
are O
contrary O
to O
Iranian O
interests O
. O

A O
Clever B-APT
Kitten E-APT
attack O
starts O
with O
the O
use O
of O
a O
web B-MAL
vulnerability I-MAL
scanner E-MAL
to O
conduct O
reconnaissance O
. O

The O
scanner O
was O
identified O
as O
the O
Acunetix B-FILE
Web I-FILE
Vulnerability I-FILE
Scanner E-FILE
which O
is O
a O
commercial O
penetration O
testing O
tool O
that O
is O
readily O
available O
as O
a O
14-day O
trial O
. O

Once O
an O
exploitable O
page O
is O
identified O
, O
Clever O
Kitten O
will O
attempt O
to O
upload O
a O
PHP O
backdoor O
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
to O
the O
system O
. O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
is O
likely O
the O
availability O
of O
exploits O
against O
web O
browsers O
, O
which O
for O
a O
variety O
of O
reasons O
allows O
an O
attacker O
to O
bypass O
security O
features O
such O
as O

( O
DEP S-TOOL
) O
or O

Once O
an O

the O
actor O
will O
attempt O
to O
upload O
a O
PHP O

In O
Clever O

the O

is O
lateral O

an O

to O
move O
further O
into O
the O

This O
activity O
is O
a O
longer O
tail O
for O
the O
actor O
than O
a O
spearphish S-ACT
; O
this O
is O
likely O
based O
on O
the O
Clever O

background O
, O
which O
may O
be O
focused O
on O
web O

Without O

that O

In O
2013 S-TIME
, O
Rapid7 S-SECTEAM
reported O
on O
a O
series O
of O
relatively O
amateur O
attacks O
against O
Pakistani O
targets O
. O

The O
first O
of O
which O
we O
call O
' O
CONFUCIUS_A S-FILE
' O
, O
a O
malware O
family O
that O
has O
links O
to O
a O
series O
of O

associated O
with O
a O
backdoor B-ACT
attack E-ACT
method O
commonly O
known O
as O
SNEEPY S-MAL
( O
aka O
ByeByeShell S-MAL

first O
reported O
by O
Rapid7 S-SECTEAM
in O
2013 S-TIME
. O

At O
first O
glance O
CONFUCIUS_B S-FILE
looks O
very O
similar O
to O
CONFUCIUS_A S-FILE
, O
and O
they O
are O
also O
packaged O
in O
plain O
SFX B-MAL
binary I-MAL

. O

The O
CONFUCIUS_B S-FILE
executable O
is O
disguised O
as O

, O
using O
a O
Right-To-Left-Override S-TOOL

and O
a O

We O
also O
believe O
that O
both O
clusters O

have O
links O
to O
attacks O
with O
likely O
Indian O
origins O
, O
the O
CONFUCIUS_A B-ACT

The O
two O

themselves O
are O
also O
very O
similar O
, O
and O
therefore O
we O
think O
that O
the O
shared O

is O
an O

of O
a O
single O

one O
of O
these O

that O
was O

publicly O

We've O
found O
that O
this O
group O
has O
continued O
to O
operate O
successfully O
, O
predominantly O
in O
Latin B-LOC
America E-LOC
, O
since O
2014 S-TIME
. O

All O
attackers O
simply O
moved O
to O
new O
C2 S-TOOL

, O
based O
largely O
around O
dynamic B-ACT

in O

In O
the O
case O
of O
Octopus S-MAL
, O
DustSquad O
used O

which O
is O
unusual O
for O
such O
an O

Some O

a O

suspected O
his O

It O
was O
a O

are O
calling O
" O
Machete O
" O
. O

At O
first O
look O
, O
it O
pretends O
to O
be O
a O
Java B-MAL

application E-MAL
but O
after O
a O
quick O
analysis O
, O
it O
was O
obvious O
this O
was O
something O
more O

just O
a O
simple O

" O
Machete O
" O
is O
a O

The O
decoy B-MAL

suggesting O
that O
the O
actors O
continually O
look O
for O

to O

their O

. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
such O
as O
Russia S-LOC
, O
the O
target O
appears O
to O
be O
an O
embassy S-IDTY

Both O

The O

the O
early O

it O
also O
points O

The O
attacker O
is O
from O

All O

, O
this O

In O

two O

According O
to O
the O
German S-LOC
press O
, O
the O
intruders O
used O
the O
Winnti B-MAL
family I-MAL

as O
their O
main O

giving O
them O
persistent O

In O
the O
case O
of O

, O
the O
activity O
groups O
strongly O
associated O
with O

BARIUM S-MAL

But O
even O
though O

the O

the O
BARIUM S-MAL

LEAD S-MAL
activity O

are O
involved O
in O
very O
different O

scenarios O
. O

To O
show O
how O
this O

we O
look O

how O
it O
provides O
extensive O

about O

BARIUM S-ACT
begins O
its O

by O
cultivating O

those O
working O

various O
social B-IDTY

During O
these O

This O

other O

, O
particularly O
the O
IT S-IDTY

in O
companies O
and O
financial B-IDTY
institutions E-IDTY
that O
increasingly O
find O
themselves O
the O
targets O
of O
cyber-attacks O
. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
the O
attackers O
only O
had O
to O
infect O
the O
computer O
on O
which O
the O
RBS O

was O
installed O
in O

to O

We O
were O
soon O
able O
to O
help O
investigate O
another O
incident O
involving O
Lurk S-MAL
. O

This O
event O
significantly O
affected O
the O
Russian B-LOC
cybercriminal E-LOC
world O
as O
the O
gang O
had O
stolen O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
rubles O
during O
a O
few O
years O
of O
activity O
, O
and O
was O
considered O
a O
" O
leader O
" O
among O
cybercriminals O
. O

In O
Russia O
, O
there O
were O
several O
relatively O
large O
cybercriminal O
groups O
engaged O
in O
financial O
theft O
via O
attacks O
on O
RBS O
. O

In O
April B-TIME
2013 E-TIME
, O
a O
year O
after O
we O
found O
the O
" O
bodiless O
" O
Lurk B-MAL
module E-MAL
, O
the O
Russian O
cybercriminal O
underground O
exploited O
several O
families O
of O
malicious O
software O
that O
specialized O
in O
attacks O
on O
banking O
software O
. O

Through O
the O
information O
exchanges O
used O
by O
people O
in O
the O
security B-IDTY
industry E-IDTY
, O
we O
learned O
that O
several O
Russian O
banks S-IDTY
were O
struggling O
with O
malicious O
programs O
created O
specifically O
to O
attack O
a O
particular O
type O
of O
legal O
banking O
software O
. O

If O
it O
did O
, O
the O
malware O
downloaded O
additional O
modules O
, O
including O
ones O
allowing O
for O
the O
automatic O
creation O
of O
unauthorized O

, O
changing O

in O

, O
etc O
. O

As O
far O
as O
we O
can O
judge O
from O
the O
data O
we O
have O
, O
in O
2014 S-TIME
the O

group O
behind O
Lurk S-MAL
seriously O
reduced O

came O

when O
our O

using O
a O

The O

The O
first O

the O
Lambert B-MAL

was O
uncovered O
publicly O
was O
in O
October B-TIME
2014 E-TIME

( O
CVE-2014-4148 S-VULID

used O
in O
the O

Interestingly O
, O
while O
most O

have O
version O

in O
the O

Green B-MAL

While O
in O

the O

remains O
unknown O
, O
the O
high B-ACT

This O
migration B-ACT

October B-TIME

Most O
of O
the O
Blue B-MAL

have O
two O
C&C S-TOOL

Some O
of O
the O
known O
filenames O
for O
Gray B-MAL
Lambert E-MAL
are O
mwapi32.dll S-MAL
and O
poolstr.dll S-MAL
– O
it O
should O
be O
pointed O
though O
that O
the O
filenames O
used O
by O
the O
Lamberts S-MAL
are O
generally O
unique O
and O
have O
never O
been O
used O
twice O
. O

Black B-MAL
Lambert E-MAL
was O
seen O
only O
briefly O
and O
we O
assume O
it O
was O
" O
retired O
" O
from O
the O
arsenal O
after O
being O
discovered O
by O
FireEye S-SECTEAM
in O
2014 S-TIME

The O
Lamberts B-MAL
toolkit E-MAL
spans O
across O
several O
years O

with O
most O
activity O
occurring O
in O
2013 S-TIME

To O
further O
exemplify O
the O
proficiency O
of O
the O
attackers O

the O
Lamberts B-MAL

deployment O
of O
Black B-MAL

Taking O

Named O
Trochilus S-MAL

this O

was O
part O

portfolio O
that O
included O
six O
other O

all O

based O
on O
the O

that O

to O
be O
stolen O
from O

. O

According O
to O
the O
security O
experts O
, O
this O
collection O
of O
malware O
was O
discovered O
after O
their O
first O
initial O
report O
was O
published O
, O
meaning O
that O
Group O
27 O
ignored O
the O
fact O
they O
were O
unmasked O

continued O
to O
infect O

Trochilus B-ACT
RAT I-ACT
activity E-ACT
was O
discovered O
during O
both O
months O
of O
October O
and O
November B-TIME
2015 E-TIME
. O

From O
September B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
through O
late O
November B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
, O
a O
threat O
actor O
group O
used O
both O
the O
Trochilus B-MAL
RAT E-MAL
and O
a O
newly O
idenfied O
RAT S-MAL
we've O
named O
MoonWind S-MAL
to O
target O
organizations O
in O
Thailand O
, O
including O
a O
utility B-IDTY
organization E-IDTY
. O

We O
chose O
the O
name O
' O
MoonWind S-MAL
' O
based O
on O
debugging O
strings O
we O
saw O
within O
the O
samples O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
compiler O
used O
to O
generate O
the O
samples O
. O

The O
attackers O
compromised O
two O
legitimate B-MAL
Thai I-MAL
websites E-MAL
to O
host O
the O
malware O
, O
which O
is O
a O
tactic O
this O
group O
has O
used O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Both O
the O
Trochilus S-MAL
and O
MoonWind B-MAL
RATs E-MAL
were O
hosted O
on O
the O
same O
compromised O
sites O
and O
used O
to O
target O
the O
same O
organization O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

The O
attackers O
used O
different O
command B-MAL
and I-MAL
control I-MAL
servers E-MAL
( O
C2s O
) O
for O
each O
malware O
family O
, O
a O
tactic O
we O
believe O
was O
meant O
to O
thwart O
attempts O
to O
tie O
the O
attacks O
together O
using O
infrastructure O
alone O
. O

Further O
research O
led O
us O
to O
additional O
MoonWind B-MAL
samples E-MAL
using O
the O
same O
C2 S-TOOL
( O
dns.webswindows.com O
) O
but O
hosted O
on O
a O
different O
compromised O
but O
legitimate B-MAL
website E-MAL
. O

The O
attacks O
in O
that O
case O
took O
place O
in O
late O
September O
to O
early O
October B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
and O
the O
attackers O
stored O
the O
MoonWind B-MAL
samples E-MAL
as O
RAR B-MAL
files E-MAL
, O
while O
in O
the O
November B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
the O
RATs S-MAL
were O
stored O
as O
executables O
. O

We O
were O
not O
able O
to O
find O
additional O
tools O
, O
but O
the O
attackers O
again O
compromised O
a O
legitimate O
Thai O
website O
to O
host O
their O
malware O
, O
in O
this O
case O
the O
student O
portal O
for O
a O
Thai O
University O
. O

Trochilus S-MAL
was O
first O
reported O
by O
Arbor B-SECTEAM

in O
their O
Seven O
Pointed O
Dagger O

tying O
its O

The O

dates O
to O
at O
least O
2013 S-TIME
and O
has O
ties O
to O
multiple O
reports O
by O
other O
researchers O
. O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
MoonWind S-MAL
is O
yet O
another O
new O
tool O
being O
used O
by O
the O
group O
or O
groups O
responsible O
for O
that O
activity O
, O
indicating O
they O
are O
not O
only O
still O
active O
but O
continuing O
to O

The O

were O
alleged O
to O
be O

On O
June B-TIME

, O
2013 S-TIME
, O
Rapid7 S-SECTEAM
released O
an O

, O
also O
exploiting O
unknown O

in O
Microsoft S-IDTY

, O
similarly O
patched O
by O
MS12-060 S-MAL
, O
but O
allegedly O
targeting O

in O
Vietnam S-LOC
and O
India S-LOC
. O

As O
we O
have O
seen O
in O
some O
previous O
targeted B-ACT
malware I-ACT
attacks E-ACT
, O
the O
attackers O
in O
this O
incident O
are O
taking O
advantage O
of O
services O
like O
changeIP
. O

com O
to O
establish O
free O
subdomains O
in O
their O
infrastructure O
. O

Blending O

with O
legitimate B-MAL
traffic E-MAL
is O
a O
common O
tactic O
used O
by O
attackers O
to O
help O
fly O
under O
the O
radar O
. O

Subdomains O
at O
phmail.us O
have O
been O
linked O
to O
malicious B-ACT
activity E-ACT
dating O
back O
as O
far O
as O
December B-TIME
2011 E-TIME
. O

Based O
on O
the O
patterns O
of O
subdomain O
registration O
over O
time O
in O
DNS S-PROT
, O
TRAC S-SECTEAM
believes O
this O
is O
an O
example O
where O
the O
attackers O
registered O
their O
own O
second-level O
domain O
. O

In O
this O
blog O
post O
we'll O
analyze O
two O
specific O
incidents O
apparently O
targeting O
victims O
in O
Vietnam S-LOC
and O
in O
India S-LOC
and O
we'll O
describe O
the O
capabilities O
of O
the O
custom O
backdoor S-MAL
being O
used O
that O
for O
convenience O
( O
and O
to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
for O
a O
lack O
of O
an O
existing O
name O
) O
we O
call O
KeyBoy S-MAL
, O
due O
to O
a O
string O
present O
in O
one O
of O
the O
samples O
. O

We O
encountered O
the O
first O
document O
exploit S-VULNAME
called O
" O
THAM B-FILE

NCKH2.doc S-FILE
" O
a O
few O
days O

, O
which O
appears O
to O
be O
leveraging O
some O
vulnerabilities O
patched O

MS12-060 S-MAL
. O

This O
document O

appears O
to O
be O

For O
the O
sake O
of O
this O

we'll O
take O
the O

an O
example O
; O
the O
one O

In O

the O
ongoing O

The O

believe O
the O
2013 S-TIME
, O
2015 S-TIME

2016 S-TIME
KeyBoy B-MAL

The O
operation O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
the O
Mofang B-APT
group E-APT
is O
a O

that O
operates O
out O
of O
China S-LOC
and O
is O
probably O
government-affiliated O
. O

merely O
their O
latest O
attack O
wave O
. O

The O
goal O
of O
the O
attackers O
appears O
to O
be O
to O
collect O
intellectual O

such O
as O

The O

started O
in O
late O
July B-TIME
2011 E-TIME
and O
continued O
into O
midSeptember O
2011 S-TIME

The O
purpose O
of O
the O
attacks O
appears O
to O
be O
industrial O
espionage O
, O
collecting O

. O

They O
then O
moved O
on O

From O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
current O
attack B-ACT

the O

began O
. O

The O
attackers O
first O
researched O
desired O
targets O
and O
then O
sent O
an O
email S-ACT
specifically O
to O
the O
target O
. O

First O
, O
when O
a O
specific O
recipient O
was O
targeted O
, O
the O
mails O
often O
purported O
to O
be O
meeting O
invitations O
from O
established O
business O
partners O
. O

While O
the O
attackers O
used O
different O
pretexts O
when O
sending O
these O
malicious B-ACT

, O
two O
methodologies O
stood O
out O
. O

Secondly O
, O
when O
the O

were O
being O

a O
broad O
set O
of O
recipients O
, O
the O
mails O
purported O
to O
be O
a O
necessary O

The O
attacks O
were O
traced O
back O
to O
a O
computer O
system O
that O
was O
a O
virtual O
private O
server O
( O

Attackers O
are O
sending O
malicious O

Operation B-ACT
Ghoul E-ACT

one O
of O
the O
many O
attacks O
in O
the O

targeting O
industrial S-IDTY

to O
be O
extra O
cautious O
while O
checking O
and O
opening O
emails B-ACT

attachments E-ACT
. O

The O
main O
point O
that O
sets O
Operation B-ACT
Groundbait E-ACT
apart O
from O
the O
other O
attacks O
is O
that O
it O
has O
mostly O
been O
targeting O
anti-government B-IDTY
separatists E-IDTY
in O
the O
self-declared O
Donetsk O
and O
Luhansk O
People O
's O
Republics O
. O

The O
attacks O
appear O
to O
be O
geopolitically O
motivated O
and O
target O
high B-IDTY
profile I-IDTY
organizations E-IDTY
. O

The O
objective O
of O
the O
attacks O
is O
clearly O
espionage O
– O
they O
involve O
gaining O
access O
to O
top O
legislative O
, O
executive O
and O
judicial O
bodies O
around O
the O
world O
. O

The O
attackers O
have O
targeted O
a O
large O
number O
of O
organizations O
globally O
since O
early O
2017 S-TIME
, O
with O
the O
main O
focus O
on O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East E-LOC
and O
North B-LOC
Africa E-LOC
( O
MENA S-LOC
) O
, O
especially O
Palestine O
. O

The O
attacks O
were O
initially O
discovered O
while O
investigating O
a O
phishing B-ACT
attack E-ACT
that O
targeted O
political S-IDTY
figures O
in O

of O
other O
CIS O

The O
main O
reason O
for O
the O
increase O
in O

detections O
in O
2014 S-TIME

2015 S-TIME
were O

The O
first O
Potao B-ACT

in O

In O
March B-TIME
2014 E-TIME
, O
the O

behind O
Potao S-MAL
started O
using O
a O
new O
infection B-MAL

Since O
March B-TIME
2015 E-TIME

In O
September B-TIME

we O
discovered O
Silence B-ACT
attack E-ACT
on O

The O
infection O

is O
a O
spear-phishing S-ACT

An O
interesting O
point O
in O
the O
Silence B-ACT

is O
that O
the O
cybercriminals O
had O
already O
compromised O

in O

to O
send O
their O
spear-phishing S-ACT

The O
spear-phishing S-ACT
infection O

is O
still O
the O
most O
popular O
ACT O
to O
initiate O

We O
conclude O
that O
the O
actor O
behind O
the O

is O
Silence O

a O
relatively O

threat O
actor O
that's O

the O

The O

on O

The O
first O
signs O
of O
Butterfly O

activities S-ACT
emerged O
in O
early B-TIME
2013 E-TIME
when O
several O
major O
technology S-IDTY

were O
compromised O
. O

However O
, O
an O
investigation O
by O
Symantec S-SECTEAM
has O
found O
that O
the O

been O
active O
since O
at O

March S-TIME
2012 S-TIME

its O
attacks O
have O
not O

Symantec S-SECTEAM

49 O
different O

Aside O
from O
the O

by O
Butterfly O

primarily O
headquartered O
in O
the O
US S-LOC

In O
the O
first O

Butterfly O
gained O
a O
foothold O
by O

attacking O
a O
small O
European O

using O
this O

then O
move O

Symantec S-SECTEAM
has O
found O
evidence O
that O
Butterfly O
has O
attacked O
three O
major O
European O
pharmaceutical B-IDTY

Butterfly S-APT
has O
also O
shown O
an O
interest O
in O
the O

attacking O
two O
major O

against O
Japan S-LOC

This O
particular O

in O

there O
is O
a O
specific O
system O

If O

the O

this O

A O
previous O
campaign O
of O
this O
APT O
group O
was O
uncovered O
by O
Talos S-SECTEAM
in O
June B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
, O
and O
since O
then O
very O
little O
of O
this O
operation O
was O
seen O
in O
the O
wild O

ined O
in O
the O

its O
metadata O
shows O
that O
its O
original O
name O
is O
Interenet B-FILE
Assistant.exe” E-FILE
. O


After O
reviewing O
all O
the O
malware O
functionalities O
, O
we O
are O
confident O
in O
saying O
that O
the O
attackers S-APT
look O
for O
victims B-IDTY
who I-IDTY
answer E-IDTY
well-defined O
characteristics O
and O
believe O
that O
further O

delivered O
only O

those O
who O
fit O
the O
specific O
victim O

In O
this O
sample O

however O
, O
the O

up O
to O

But O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
attackers S-APT
known O
affection O
for O
decoy O
documents O
that O
pose O
as O
news O
summaries O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
date O
the O
campaign O
back O
to O
March B-TIME
2018 E-TIME

With O
the O
experience O
gained O
from O
the O
APT B-ACT
attack E-ACT
that O
began O
in O
March B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
, O
it O
seems O
this O
campaign O
has O
evolved O
into O
an O
attack O
with O
new O
capabilities O
, O
and O
an O
even O
more O
specific O

, O
over O
a O

These O
unknown B-APT

continued O
launching O

For O
simplicity O

Kaspersky S-SECTEAM

calling O
them O
the O
BlackEnergy E-APT

go O
back O
as O

as O
June B-TIME

BlackEnergy S-APT
is O
a O
highly O
dynamic O
threat O
actor O
and O
the O
current O
attacks O
in O
Ukraine S-LOC
indicate O
that O
destructive O
actions O
are O
on O
their O
main O
agenda O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
compromising O
industrial O

installations O
and O

Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
will O
continue O
to O
monitor O
the O
BlackEnergy S-APT

in O
Ukraine S-LOC

update O
our O
readers O
with O
more O
data O
when O

From O
Buhtrap S-APT
perpetrating O
cybercrime O
for O
financial O
gain O
, O
its O
toolset O

been O
expanded O
with O

conduct O

in O
Eastern B-LOC
Europe E-LOC

Throughout O
our O
tracking O
, O
we've S-SECTEAM
seen O
this B-APT
group E-APT
deploy O
its O
main O
backdoor S-ACT
as O
well O
as O
other O
tools O
against O
various O
victims O
, O
but O
June B-TIME
2019 E-TIME
was O
the O
first O
time O
we O
saw O
the O
Buhtrap S-APT
group O
use O
a O
zero-day B-ACT
exploit E-ACT
as O
part O
of O
a O
campaign O
. O


In O
that O
case O
, O
we O
observed O
Buhtrap S-APT

a O
local O
privilege O

exploit S-VULNAME
, O
CVE-2019-1132 S-VULID
, O
against O
one O
of O
its O

. O


However O
, O
as O
the O
shift O
in O
targets O
occurred O
before O
the O
source O
code O

, O
we O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
the O

people O
behind O
the O
first O

attacks O
against O
businesses S-IDTY

also O

in O

When O

, O
the O
decoy O

would O
typically O
be O

warning O
that O

In O
the O

campaign O
, O
Talos S-SECTEAM
was O
able O
to O
identify O
two O
distinct O
groups O
of O
victims O
. O


The O
first O
group O
, O
we O
identify O
as O
primary O
victims O
, O
includes O
national B-IDTY

organizations E-IDTY
, O
ministries S-IDTY
of O
foreign O

prominent B-IDTY
energy I-IDTY

. O


The O
threat O
actors S-APT
behind O
the O
Sea B-ACT
Turtle E-ACT
campaign O
show O
clear O
signs O
of O
being O
highly O
capable O
and O
brazen O
in O
their O
endeavors O
. O


In O
most O
cases O
, O
threat O
actors S-APT
typically O
stop O
or O
slow B-ACT
down I-ACT
their I-ACT
activities E-ACT
once O
their O
campaigns O
are O
publicly O
revealed O
. O


The O
threat O
actors S-APT
behind O
the O
Sea B-ACT
Turtle E-ACT
campaign O
were O
successful O
in O
compromising O
entities O
by O
manipulating O
and O
falsifying O
DNS S-PROT
records O
at O
various O
levels O
in O
the O
domain O

If O
an O
attacker S-APT
was O
able O
to O
compromise O
an O
organization's O
network O
administrator O
credentials O
, O
the O
attacker O
would O
be O
able O
to O
change O
that O
particular O
organization's O
DNS S-PROT
records O
at O
will O
. O


If O
the O
attackers S-APT
were O
able O
to O
obtain O
one O
of O
these O
EPP O
keys O
, O
they O
would O
be O
able O
to O
modify O
any O
DNS S-PROT
records O
that O
were O
managed O
by O
that O
particular O
registrar O

Captured O
legitimate O

The O
diagram O
below O
illustrates O
how O
we O
believe O
the O
actors O
behind O
the O
Sea B-FILE
Turtle E-FILE
campaign O
used O
DNS S-PROT
hijacking O
to O
achieve O
their O
end O
goals O
. O


As O
of O
early B-TIME
2019 E-TIME
, O
the O
only O
evidence O
of O
the O
spear-phishing S-ACT
threat B-APT
vector E-APT
came O
from O
a O
compromised O
organization's O
public O
disclosure O
. O


On O
January O
4 O
, O
Packet O
Clearing O

, O
which O
is O
not O
an O
Internet O
exchange O
point O
but O
rather O
is O
an O
NGO O
which O
provides O
support O
to O
Internet O
exchange O
points O
and O
the O
core O
of O
the O
domain O
name O
system O
, O
provided O
confirmation O
of O
this O
aspect O
of O
the O
actors’ S-APT
tactics O
when O
it O
publicly O
revealed O
its O
internal O
DNS S-PROT
had O
been O
briefly O
hijacked S-ACT
as O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
compromise O
at O
its O
domain O
registrar O
. O


During O
a O
typical O
incident O
, O
the O
actor S-APT
would O
modify O
the O
NS O
records O
for O
the O
targeted O
organization O
, O
pointing O
users O
to O
a O
malicious O
DNS S-PROT
server O
that O
provided O
actor-controlled O
responses O
to O
all O
DNS S-PROT
queries O
. O


The O
next O
step O
for O
the O
actor S-APT
was O
to O
build O
MitM B-MAL
servers E-MAL
that O
impersonated O
legitimate O
services O
to O
capture O
user O
credentials O
. O


In O
addition O
to O
the O
MitM B-MAL
server E-MAL
IP S-PROT
addresses O
published O
in O
previous O
reports O
, O
Talos S-SECTEAM
identified O
16 O
additional B-MAL
servers E-MAL
leveraged O
by O
the O
actor S-APT
during O
the O
observed O
attacks O
. O


The O
attackers S-APT
would O
then O
use O
the O
certificate O
on O
actor-controlled O
servers O
to O
perform O
additional O
MitM S-MAL
operations O
to O
harvest O
additional O
credentials O
. O


In O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
victims O
were O
redirected O
to O
these O
actor-controlled S-APT
servers S-MAL
displaying O
the O
stolen O
certificate O
. O


One O
notable O
aspect O
of O
the O
campaign O
was O
the O
actors' S-APT
ability O
to O
impersonate O
VPN B-MAL
applications E-MAL
, O
such O
as O
Cisco O
Adaptive B-MAL
Security I-MAL
Appliance E-MAL
(ASA) O
products O
, O
to O
perform O
MitM O
attacks O
. O


At O
this O
time O
, O
we O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
the O
attackers S-APT
found O
a O
new O
ASA S-TOOL
exploit S-VULNAME
. O


Rather O
, O
they S-APT
likely O
abused O
the O
trust O
relationship O
associated O
with O
the O
ASA's S-MAL
SSL O
certificate O
to O
harvest O
VPN S-TOOL
credentials O
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
to O
the O
victim's O
network O
. O


As O
an O
example O
, O
DNS S-PROT
records O
indicate O
that O
a O
targeted O
domain O
resolved O
to O
an O
actor-controlled S-APT
MitM B-MAL
server E-MAL
. O


In O
another O
case O
, O
the O
attackers S-APT
were O
able O
to O
compromise B-ACT
NetNod E-ACT
, O
a O
non-profit O
, O
independent O
internet O
infrastructure O
organization O
based O
in O
Sweden S-LOC
. O


Using O
this O
access O
, O
the O
threat O
actors S-APT
were O
able O
to O
manipulate S-ACT
the O
DNS S-PROT
records O
for O
sa1[.]dnsnode[.]net O
. O


This O
redirection O
allowed O
the O
attackers S-APT
to O
harvest O
credentials O
of O
administrators O
who O
manage O
domains O
with O
the O
TLD O
of O
Saudi B-LOC

In O
one O
of O
the O
more O
recent O
campaigns S-ACT
on O
March B-TIME

, O
2019 O
, O
the O
threat O
actors S-APT
targeted O
the O
Sweden-based O
consulting O
firm O
Cafax S-IDTY
. O


We O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
Sea B-ACT
Turtle E-ACT
was O
targeted O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
re-establish O
access O
to O
the O
NetNod S-IDTY
network O
, O
which O
was O
previously O
compromised O
by O
this O
threat O
actor O
. O


Obtaining O
access O
to O
this O
ccTLD O
registrars O
would O
have O
allowed O
attackers S-APT
to O
hijack O
any O
domain O
that O
used O
those O
ccTLDs O
. O


These O
actors S-APT
perform O
DNS S-PROT
hijacking O
through O
the O

of O

a O
number B-IDTY
of I-IDTY

Sectigo S-MAL
, O
and O
self-signed B-MAL

Once O
they O
have O
access B-ACT

they S-APT
steal O
the O

legitimate O

we O
believe O
that O
the O
Sea B-ACT

campaign O
continues O
to O
be O
highly O
successful O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O


Had O
more O

especially O
in O
complex O

such O
as O
the O
Middle B-LOC

The O

starts O

by O
sending O
basic O

What O
lied O
beneath O
this O
facade O
was O
a O
well-engineered O
campaign O
of O

designed O
to O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
in O
December B-TIME
2016 E-TIME
, O
Amnesty O
International O
published O
an O
investigation O
into O
another O

It O
appears O
that O
the O

may O
have O
impersonated O
the O

stole O

stolen O

In O
the O
course O
of O
this O

, O
the O
attacker S-APT
— O

then O
sent O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O

The O
attackers S-APT

Among O
the O

Operation B-APT
Pawn I-APT
Storm E-APT
is O
an O
active O
economic S-IDTY

political S-IDTY
cyber-espionage O
operation O
that O
targets O
a O

, O

and O
the O

. O


we O
believe O
the O
iOS O
malware O
gets O
installed O
on O
already O
compromised O
systems O
, O
and O
it O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
next O
stage O
SEDNIT S-FILE

we O
have O
found O
for O
Microsoft S-IDTY

we O
found O
two O

The O
obvious O
goal O
of O
the O

we O
discovered O
a O

five O

Just O
to O

The O
dropper S-ACT
first O
appeared O
in O
mid-July S-TIME
, O
suggesting O
that O
this O
APT O
activity O
is O
potentially O
ongoing O
, O
with O
Turla S-APT
actively O
targeting O
G20 S-IDTY
participants O
and/or O
those O
with O
interest O
in O
the O
G20 O
, O
including O
member O
nations O
, O
journalists O
, O
and O
policymakers O
. O


Turla S-APT
is O
a O
well-documented O
, O
long O
operating O
APT O
group O
that O
is O
widely O
believed O
to O
be O
a O
Russian S-LOC
state-sponsored O
organization O
. O


Turla S-APT
is O
perhaps O
most O
notoriously O
suspected O
as O
responsible O
for O
the O
breach O
of O
the O
United O
States O
Central O
Command O
in O
2008 S-ACT
. O


More O
recently O
Turla S-APT
was O
accused O
of O
breaching O
RUAG S-IDTY
, O
a O
Swiss O
technology O
company O
, O
in O
a O
public O
report O
published O
by O
GovCERT.ch S-SECTEAM
. O


The O
delivery O
of O
KopiLuwak O
in O
this O
instance O
is O
currently O
unknown O
as O
the O
MSIL B-FILE
dropper E-FILE
has O
only O
been O
observed O
by O
Proofpoint S-SECTEAM
researchers O
on O
a O
public O
malware O
repository O
. O


Assuming O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak O
has O
been O
observed O
in O
the O
wild O
, O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O
ACTs O
it O
may O
have O
been O
delivered O
including O
some O
of O
Turla’s S-APT
previous O
attack O
methods O
such O
as O
spear B-ACT
phishing E-ACT
or O
via O
a O
watering B-ACT
hole E-ACT
. O


This O
could O
include O
diplomats S-IDTY
, O
experts O
in O
the O
LOCs O
of O
interest O
related O
to O
the O
Digital O
Economy O
Task O
Force O
, O
or O
possibly O
even O
journalists S-IDTY
. O


Turla's S-APT
goal O
could O
include O
diplomats O
, O
experts O
in O
the O
LOCs O
of O
interest O
related O
to O
the O
Digital B-IDTY
Economy E-IDTY
Task O
Force O
, O
or O
possibly O
even O
journalists O
. O


The O
earliest O
step O
in O
any O
possible O
attack(s) O
involving O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak S-FILE
of O
which O
Proofpoint O
researchers O
are O
currently O
aware O
begin O
with O
the O
MSIL B-FILE
dropper E-FILE
. O


The O
basic O
chain O
of O
events O
upon O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL B-FILE
dropper E-FILE
include O
dropping O
and O
executing O
both O
a O
PDF S-TOOL
decoy O
and O
a O
Javascript B-FILE
(JS) I-FILE
dropper E-FILE
. O


As O
explained O
in O
further O
detail O
below O
, O
the O
JS B-FILE
dropper E-FILE
ultimately O
installs O
a O
JS B-FILE
decryptor E-FILE
onto O
an O
infected O
machine O
that O
will O
then O
finally O
decrypt O
and O
execute O
the O
actual O
KopiLuwak S-FILE
backdoor O
in O
memory O
only O
. O


As O
Proofpoint S-SECTEAM
has O
not O
yet O
observed O
this O
attack O
in O
the O
wild O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
there O
is O
an O
additional O
component O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL B-FILE
payload E-FILE
. O


The O
newer O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak S-FILE
is O
now O
capable O
of O
exfiltrating O
files O
to O
the O
C&C S-TOOL
as O
well O
as O
downloading O
files O
and O
saving O
them O
to O
the O
infected O
machine O
. O


Despite O
the O
added O
capabilities O
, O
we O
still O
agree O
with O
Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
that O
this O
backdoor O
is O
likely O
used O
as O
an O
initial O
reconnaissance O
tool O
and O
would O
probably O
be O
used O
as O
a O
staging O
point O
to O
deploy O
one O
of O
Turla’s S-APT
more O
fully O
featured O
implants O
. O


Turla S-APT
is O
a O
complex O
cyberattack O
platform O
focused O
predominantly O
on O
diplomatic O

Explicit O

unusual O
among O

and O
evidence O

APT41 S-APT
has O
conducted O
simultaneous O
cyber O

Cyber B-ACT

operations O
from O
2014 S-TIME

APT41 S-APT
operations O
against O
higher B-IDTY
education E-IDTY
, O
travel B-IDTY
services E-IDTY
, O
and O
news/media B-IDTY
firms E-IDTY
provide O
some O
indication O
that O
the O
group O
also O
tracks O
individuals O
and O
conducts O
surveillance O
. O


For O
example O
, O
the O
group O
has O
repeatedly O
targeted O
call O
record O
information O
at O
telecom S-IDTY
companies S-IDTY
. O


APT41 S-APT
has O
established O
and O
maintained O
strategic O

to O
organizations O
in O
the O
healthcare S-IDTY
, O
high-tech S-IDTY
, O
and O
telecommunications S-IDTY
sectors S-IDTY
. O


The O
group’s O
financially O
motivated O
activity O
has O
primarily O
focused O
on O
the O
video B-IDTY
game I-IDTY
industry E-IDTY
, O
where O
APT41 S-APT
has O
manipulated S-ACT
virtual O
currencies O
and O
even O
attempted O
to O
deploy S-ACT
ransomware S-ACT
. O


In O
another O
instance O
, O
APT41 S-APT
targeted O
a O
hotel’s O
reservation O
systems O
ahead O
of O
Chinese O
officials O
staying O
there O
, O
suggesting O
the O
group O
was O
tasked O
to O
reconnoiter O
the O

reasons O

These O
supply B-ACT
chain E-ACT
compromise O
tactics O
have O
also O
been O
characteristic O
of O
APT41’s S-APT
best O
known O
and O
most O
recent O
espionage O
campaigns O
. O


Interestingly O
, O
despite O
the O
significant O
effort O
required O
to O
execute O
supply O
chain O
compromises O
and O
the O
large O
number O
of O
affected O
organizations O
, O
APT41 S-APT
limits S-ACT
the O
deployment O
of O
follow-on O
malware O
to O
specific O
victim O
systems O
by O
matching S-ACT
against O
individual O
system O
identifiers O
. O


Mapping O
the O
group’s O
activities O
since O
2012 O
(Figure O
2) O
also O
provides O
some O
indication O
that O
APT41 S-APT
primarily O
conducts S-ACT
financially O
motivated O
operations O
outside O
of O
their O
normal O
day O
jobs O
. O


The O
latter O
is O
especially O
notable O
because O
APT41 S-APT
has O
repeatedly O
returned O
to O
targeting O
the O
video B-IDTY
game I-IDTY
industry E-IDTY
and O
we O
believe O
these O
activities O
were O
formative O
in O
the O
group’s O
later O
espionage O
operations O
. O


APT41 S-APT
leverages O
an O
arsenal O
of O
over O
46 O
different O
malware B-MAL
families E-MAL
and O
tools S-MAL
to O
accomplish O
their O
missions O
, O
including O
publicly O
available O

, O

shared O
with O
other O
Chinese O
espionage O
operations O
, O
and O
tools O
unique O
to O
the O
group O
. O


Once O
in O
a O
victim O
organization O
, O
APT41 S-APT
can O
leverage S-ACT
more O
sophisticated O
TTPs O
and O
deploy B-ACT
additional I-ACT
malware E-ACT
. O


APT41 S-APT
often O
relies O
on O
spear-phishing S-ACT
emails S-TOOL
with O
attachments O
such O
as O
compiled O
HTML S-TOOL
( O
.chm S-FILE
) O
files O
to O
initially O
compromise O
their O
victims O

APT41 S-APT
has O
also O
deployed B-ACT
rootkits E-ACT

Master B-TOOL
Boot I-TOOL

bootkits O
on O
a O
limited O
basis O
to O
hide O
their O
malware O
and O
maintain O
persistence O
on O
select O
victim O
systems O
. O


The O
limited O
use O
of O
these O
tools O
by O
APT41 S-APT
suggests O
the O
group O
reserves O
more O
advanced O
TTPs O
and O
malware O
only O
for O
high-value O
targets O
. O


Like O
other O
Chinese O
espionage O
operators O
, O
APT41 S-APT
appears O
to O
have O
moved O
toward O
strategic O
intelligence O
collection O
and O
establishing O
access O
and O
aACT O
from O
direct O
intellectual O
property O

since O
2015 S-TIME

This O
shift O
, O
however O
, O
has O
not O
affected O
the O

In O
April B-TIME

Based O
on O
the O
functionality O
of O
the O
various O
tools O
uploaded O
to O
the O
webshells S-TOOL
, O
we O
believe O
the O
threat O
actors S-APT
breach O
the O

to O
use O
as O
a O
beachhead O
, O
then O
attempt O
to O
move O

. O


We O
also O
observed O
the O
actors S-APT
uploading O
custom O

such O
as O
HyperBro S-MAL
which O
is O
commonly O
associated O
with O
Emissary B-APT
Panda E-APT
. O


Both O
of O
these O
alerts O
discussed O
campaigns O
in O
which O
actors S-APT
used O
the O
CVE-2019-0604 S-VULID
to O
exploit S-VULNAME
SharePoint O
servers O
to O
install O
the O
China B-MAL
Chopper I-MAL
webshell E-MAL
. O


During O
our O
research O
into O
this O
attack O
campaign O
, O
Unit B-SECTEAM
42 E-SECTEAM
gathered O
several O
tools O
that O
the O
Emissary B-APT
Panda E-APT
uploaded O
to O
the O
three O
webshells S-TOOL
at O
the O
two O
government B-IDTY
organizations E-IDTY
. O


We O
also O
observed O
the O
actors S-APT
uploading O
the O
HyperBro B-MAL
backdoor E-MAL
to O
one O
of O
the O
webshells S-TOOL
, O
as O
well O
as O
legitimate O
executables O
that O
would O
sideload B-ACT
malicious E-ACT
DLLs S-ACT
that O
have O
overlapping O
code O
associated O
with O
known O
Emissary B-APT
Panda E-APT
activity O
. O


Lastly O
, O
we O
saw O
the O
actor S-APT
uploading O
a O
custom O
backdoor O
called O
HyperBro S-MAL
, O
which O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
Emissary B-APT
Panda E-APT
operations O
in O
the O
past O

The O
other O
overlapping O

are O
tools O
used O
by O
the O
adversary O
to O
locate O
other O

the O
network O
( O

, O
check O

Also O
, O
the O
NCSC O

mentioned O
that O
the O

used O
a O

for O
their O

, O
which O
is O
the O
same O

we O
saw O
associated O

. O


we O
will O
provide O
an O
analysis O
of O
the O
HyperBro S-FILE
tool O
in O
an O
upcoming O
section O
. O


However O
, O
using O
NCC S-SECTEAM
Group’s O
research O
published O
in O
May O
2018 S-TIME
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
discover O
code O
overlaps O
between O
these O
DLLs O
and O
a O
sideloaded O
DLL S-TOOL
that O
ran O
the O
SysUpdate O
tool O
that O
the O
NCC S-SECTEAM
group O
has O
associated O
with O
an O
Emissary B-APT
Panda E-APT
campaign O
. O


The O
list O
also O
includes O
several O
hack B-MAL
tools E-MAL
, O
such O
as O
Mimikatz S-MAL
for O

and O
several O
compiled O
python B-MAL

used O
to O
locate O

compromise O
other O

on O
the O
local O
network O
. O


Unfortunately O
, O
we O
do O
not O
have O
access O
to O
the O
PYTHON33.hlp O
or O
CreateTsMediaAdm.hlp O
files O
, O
so O
we O
do O
not O
know O
the O
final O

loaded O
by O
either O
of O
these O

The O
Emissary B-APT

at O
two O
Government O

which O
we O

tracked O
in O
CVE-2019-0604 S-VULID

The O

According O
to O
Microsoft’s S-SECTEAM

we O
first O

We O
believe O
the O
actors S-APT
pivoted O
to O
other O

on O
the O
network O
using O
stolen B-ACT

Once O
the O
adversary O
established O
a O

on O
the O

, O
they S-APT
used O
China B-MAL

to O
upload O
additional O

We O
also O
observed O

In O
2018 S-TIME

Kaspersky S-SECTEAM
Labs O
published O
a O
report O
that O
analyzed O
a O
Turla S-APT
PowerShell B-MAL
loader E-MAL
that O
was O
based O
on O
the O
open-source O
project O
Posh-SecMod O
. O


Turla S-APT
is O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2008 S-TIME
, O
when O
it O
successfully O
breached O
the O
US O
military S-IDTY
. O


This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Turla S-APT
has O
used O
PowerShell S-MAL
in-memory O
loaders O
to O
increase O
its O
chances O
of O
bypassing O
security O
products O
. O


However O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
the O
same O
scripts O
are O
used O
more O
globally O
against O
many O
traditional O
Turla S-APT
targets O
in O
Western B-LOC
Europe E-LOC
and O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East E-LOC
. O


In O
some O
samples O
deployed O
since O
March B-TIME
2019 E-TIME
, O
Turla S-APT

modified O
their O

Based O
on O
our O
research O
, O
SWEED S-APT
— O
which O
has O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2017 S-TIME
— O
primarily O
targets O
their O
victims O
with O
stealers O
and O
remote O
access O
trojans O
. O


It O
is O
interesting O
to O
note O
that O
Turla S-APT
operators O
used O
the O
free O
email S-TOOL
provider O
GMX O
again O
, O
as O
in O
the O
Outlook B-MAL
Backdoor E-MAL
and O
in O
LightNeuron S-MAL
. O


This O
new O
research O
confirms O
our O
forecast O
and O
shows O
that O
the O
Turla S-APT
group O
does O
not O
hesitate O
to O
use O
open-source O
pen-testing O
frameworks S-MAL
to O
conduct O
intrusion O
. O


Neptun S-FILE
is O
installed O
on O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Exchange O
servers O
and O
is O
designed O
to O
passively O
listen O
for O
commands O
from O
the O
attackers S-APT
. O


One O
attack O
during O
this O
campaign O
involved O
the O
use O
of O
infrastructure O
belonging O
to O
another O
espionage O
group O
known O
as O
Crambus S-APT
aka O
OilRig S-APT
, O
APT34 S-APT
. O


Waterbug S-APT
has O
been O
using O
Meterpreter S-MAL
since O
at O
least O
early B-TIME
2018 E-TIME
and O
, O
in O
this O
campaign O
, O
used O
a O
modified O
version O
of O
Meterpreter S-MAL
, O
which O
was O
encoded O
and O
given O
a O
.wav O
extension O
in O
order O
to O
disguise O
its O
true O
purpose O
. O


In O
all O
likelihood O
, O
Waterbug’s S-APT
use O
of O
Crambus B-MAL
infrastructure E-MAL
appears O
to O
have O
been O
a O
hostile O
takeover O
. O


One O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
things O
to O
occur O
during O
one O
of O
Waterbug’s S-APT
recent O
campaigns O
was O
that O
during O
an O
attack O
against O
one O
target O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East E-LOC
, O
Waterbug S-APT
appeared O
to O
hijack O
infrastructure O
from O
the O
Crambus O
espionage O
group O
and O
used O
it O
to O
deliver O
malware O
on O
to O
the O
victim’s O
network O
. O


These O
three O
recent O
Waterbug S-APT
campaigns O
have O
seen O
the O
group O
compromise B-IDTY
governments E-IDTY
and O
international B-IDTY
organizations E-IDTY
across O
the O
globe O
in O
addition O
to O
targets O
in O
the O
IT S-IDTY
and O
education B-IDTY
sectors E-IDTY
. O


Curiously O
though O
, O
Waterbug S-APT
also O
compromised O
other O
computers O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
using O
its O
own O
infrastructure S-IDTY
. O


Symantec S-SECTEAM
believes O
that O
the O
variant O
of O
Mimikatz S-MAL
used O
in O
this O
attack O
is O
unique O
to O
Waterbug S-APT
. O


Aside O
from O
the O
attack O
involving O
Crambus O
infrastructure O
, O
this O
sample O
of O
Mimikatz S-MAL
has O
only O
been O
seen O
used O
in O
one O
other O
attack O
, O
against O
an O
education S-IDTY
target O
in O
the O
UK S-LOC
in O
2017 S-TIME
. O


The O
first O
observed O
evidence O
of O
Waterbug S-APT
activity O
came O
on O
January B-TIME
11 E-TIME
, O
2018 S-TIME
, O
when O
a O
Waterbug-linked O
tool O
(a O
task O

named O
msfgi.exe S-FILE
) O
was O
dropped O
on O
to O
a O
computer O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
. O


In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
attack O
against O
the O
Middle B-LOC
Eastern E-LOC
target O
, O
Crambus S-APT
was O
the O
first O
group O
to O
compromise O
the O
victim’s O
network O
, O
with O
the O
earliest O
evidence O
of O
activity O
dating O
to O
November B-TIME
2017 E-TIME
. O


Waterbug’s S-APT
intrusions O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
continued O
for O
much O
of O
2018 S-TIME
. O


Symantec S-SECTEAM
did O
not O
observe O
the O
initial O
access O
point O
and O
the O
close O
timeframe O
between O
Waterbug S-APT
observed O
activity O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
and O
its O
observed O
use O
of O
Crambus O
infrastructure O
suggests O
that O
Waterbug S-APT
may O
have O
used O
the O
Crambus B-IDTY
infrastructure E-IDTY
as O
an O
initial O
access O
point O
. O

It O
also O
reconfigures O
the O
Microsoft S-IDTY
Sysinternals O
registry O
to O
prevent O
pop-ups O
when O
running O
the O
PsExec B-MAL
tool E-MAL
. O


Waterbug S-APT
also O
used O
an O
older O
version O
of O
PowerShell S-MAL
, O
likely O
to O
avoid O
logging O
. O


In O
one O
of O
these O
campaigns O
, O
Waterbug S-APT
used O
a O
USB B-MAL
stealer E-MAL
that O
scans O
removable O
storage O
devices O
to O
identify O
and O
collect O
files O
of O
interest O

The O

that O

likely O

Lately O
, O
Patchwork S-APT
has O
been O
sending O
multiple O
RTF B-FILE

exploiting O
CVE-2017-8570 S-VULID
. O

The O
first O
of O
which O
we O
call O
' O
CONFUCIUS_A S-FILE
' O
, O
a O
malware O
family O
that O
has O
links O
to O
a O
series O
of O
attacks O
associated O
with O
a O
backdoor B-ACT
attack E-ACT
method O
commonly O
known O
as O
SNEEPY S-MAL
( O
aka O
ByeByeShell S-MAL
) O
first O
reported O
by O
Rapid7 S-SECTEAM
in O
2013 S-TIME
. O

At O
first O
glance O
CONFUCIUS_B S-FILE
looks O
very O
similar O
to O
CONFUCIUS_A S-FILE
, O
and O
they O
are O
also O
packaged O
in O
plain O
SFX B-MAL
binary I-MAL

. O

The O
CONFUCIUS_B S-FILE
executable O
is O
disguised O
as O
a O

, O
using O
a O
Right-To-Left-Override S-TOOL
( O
RTLO S-TOOL
) O
trick O
and O
a O
false O

. O

We O
also O
believe O
that O
both O
clusters O
of O
activity O
have O
links O
to O
attacks O
with O
likely O
Indian O
origins O
, O
the O
CONFUCIUS_A B-ACT
attacks E-ACT
are O
linked O
to O
the O
use O
of O
SNEEPY/BYEBYESHELL S-MAL
and O
the O
CONFUCIUS_B S-FILE
have O
a O
loose O
link O
to O
Hangover S-MAL
. O

The O
two O
malware O
families O
themselves O
are O
also O
very O
similar O
, O
and O
therefore O
we O
think O
that O
the O
shared O
technique O
is O
an O
indication O
of O
a O
single O
developer O
, O
or O
development B-IDTY
company E-IDTY

we O
believe O
the O
iOS O

gets O
installed O
on O
already O
compromised O
systems O
, O
and O
it O
is O
very O
similar O
to O

SEDNIT S-FILE

we O
have O
found O
for O
Microsoft S-IDTY

One O
is O
called O
XAgent S-FILE
detected O
as O

the O
other O
one O
uses O
the O

of O
a O
legitimate O

, O
MadCap S-FILE
detected O
as O
IOS_ O
XAGENT.B S-FILE
. O

Madcap” S-FILE
is O
similar O
to O
the O
XAgent S-FILE
malware O
, O
but O
the O
former O
is O
focused O
on O
recording O
audio O
. O

This O
full-blown O
spying O
framework O
consists O
of O
two O
packages O
named O
‘Tokyo’ S-FILE

‘Yokohama’ S-FILE
. O

Just O
to O
highlight O
its O
capabilities O
, O
TajMahal S-FILE
is O
able O
to O
steal O
data O
from O
a O
CD O
burnt O
by O
a O
victim O
as O
well O
as O
from O
the O

The O
first O
confirmed O
date O
when O
TajMahal S-FILE

were O
seen O
on O
a O

The O
delivery O
of O

in O
this O
instance O

currently O
unknown O

has O
only O
been O
observed O
by O
Proofpoint S-SECTEAM

The O
earliest O
step O
in O
any O
possible O
attack(s) O
involving O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak S-FILE
of O
which O
Proofpoint O
researchers O
are O
currently O
aware O
begin O
with O
the O
MSIL B-FILE
dropper E-FILE
. O

The O
basic O
chain O
of O
events O
upon O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL B-FILE
dropper E-FILE
include O
dropping O
and O
executing O
both O
a O
PDF S-TOOL
decoy O
and O
a O
Javascript B-FILE
(JS) I-FILE
dropper E-FILE
. O

As O
explained O
in O
further O
detail O
below O
, O
the O
JS B-FILE
dropper E-FILE
ultimately O
installs O
a O
JS B-FILE
decryptor E-FILE
onto O
an O
infected O
machine O
that O
will O
then O
finally O
decrypt O
and O
execute O
the O
actual O
KopiLuwak S-FILE
backdoor O
in O
memory O
only O
. O

As O
Proofpoint S-SECTEAM
has O
not O
yet O
observed O
this O
attack O
in O
the O
wild O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
there O
is O
an O
additional O
component O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL B-FILE
payload E-FILE
. O

The O
newer O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak S-FILE
is O
now O
capable O
of O
exfiltrating O

as O
well O
as O
downloading O

The O

The O
main O
point O
that O
sets O
Operation B-ACT
Groundbait E-ACT
apart O
from O
the O
other O
attacks O
is O
that O
it O
has O
mostly O
been O
targeting O
anti-government B-IDTY
separatists E-IDTY
in O
the O
self-declared O
Donetsk O
and O
Luhansk O
People O

Republics O
. O

Although O

also O
sent O

However O
, O
some O

were O
sent O

more O
than O
25 O

An O
interesting O
point O
in O
the O
Silence B-ACT
attack E-ACT
is O
that O
the O
cybercriminals O
had O
already O
compromised O
banking S-IDTY
infrastructure O
in O
order O
to O
send O
their O
spear-phishing S-ACT

For O

After O

all O

we O
are O
confident O
in O
saying O
that O
the O

look O
for O
victims B-IDTY

believe O
that O

Through O

This O

Our O

The O
main O
point O
that O
sets O

that O

some O

An O
interesting O
point O
in O
the O
Silence B-ACT

is O
that O
the O

already O

After O
deobfuscating O

we O

visitors O

that O

However O
, O
once O
the O
victim O
enters O
an O

password O

A O

pop O
out O

The O
pop-out O

is O
just O
smoke O

where O
nothing O
actually O
happens O
once O
the O

We O
analyzed O

Once O
the O

an O

it O

initiate O

The O

an O

We O
decoded O

that O

While O
Operation B-ACT
Emmental E-ACT
was O
able O
to O
bypass O
two-way O
authentication O
by O
tricking O
its O
victims O
into O
installing O
a O
fake B-TOOL
app E-TOOL
, O
we O
have O
not O
observed O
OSX_DOK.C S-MAL
doing O
this O
. O

However O
, O
since O
they O
can O
inject O
code O
into O
the O
webpage O
, O
it O
means O
they O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
do O
this O
as O
well O
. O

We O
performed O
static O
analysis O
on O
the O
sample O
and O
found O
it O
packed O
by O
Ultimate B-TOOL
Packer E-TOOL
for O

( O
UPX O
) O
, O
an O
open O

packer O
that O
can O
often O
be O
abused O
by O
malware S-MAL
. O

We O
successfully O
unpacked O
the O
initial O
sample O
we O
found O
dropped O
by O
the O
UPX B-TOOL
unpacker E-TOOL
. O

The O
malware S-MAL
is O
not O
obfuscated O
so O
we O
easily O
found O
interesting O
strings O
here O
. O

We O
can O
see O
that O
the O
malware S-MAL
relies O
on O
bash O
shell O
for O
most O
of O
its O
setup O
. O

We O
were O
not O
able O
to O
unpack O
the O
sample O
discovered O
after O
June B-TIME

, I-TIME
2017 E-TIME
. O

The O
UPX S-TOOL
gave O
a O
warning O
message O
about O
memory O

. O

The O
malware S-MAL
author O
seemingly O
made O
unpacking O
the O
malware O
more O
difficult O
to O
slow O
down O
or O
even O
evade O
the O
antivirus O
engine O
’s O
scanning O
process O
. O

The O
packer O
is O
the O
same O
but O
the O
malware O
tries O
to O
exploit O
the O
undiscovered O
bug O
in O
the O
UPX S-TOOL
library O
that O
causes O
unpack O
failure O
. O

We O
have O
reported O
the O
issues O
to O
the O
UPX S-TOOL
team O
, O
and O
they O
have O
already O
fixed O
it O
. O

The O
impacted O
versions O
of O
the O
UPX S-TOOL
library O
are O
3.94 O
, O
3.93 O
, O
and O
3.92 O
. O

This O
technique O
enables O
the O
malware O
to O
efficiently O
run O
while O
evading O
unpacking O
techniques O
from O
the O
AntiVirus-integrated O
UPX O
library O
. O

As O
mentioned O
earlier O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
OSX_DOK.C S-MAL
might O
be O
the O
MAC S-OS
OS O
X O
version O
of O
WERDLOD S-MAL
, O
an O
online O
banking O
malware S-MAL
that O
used O
the O
same O
techniques O
as O
Operation B-TOOL
Emmental E-TOOL
. O

Other O
research O
have O
also O
connected O
the O
OSX S-OS
malware O
and O
Retefe O
( O
the O
external O
term O
used O
for O
WERDLOD S-MAL
) O
via O
similarities O
in O
their O
behavior O
. O

While O
OSX_DOK.C S-MAL
is O
designed O
for O
MAC S-OS B-TOOL
OS I-TOOL
X E-TOOL
, O
which O
is O
a O
Unix-like O

, O
WERDLOD S-MAL
is O
designed O
for O
Windows S-OS
. O

But O
in O
terms O
of O
features O
and O
behaviors O
, O
these O
two O
malware O
are O
very O
similar O
. O

Here O
is O
a O
list O
of O
their O
similarities O
. O

Both O
malware O
kill O
all O
current O
browsers O
before O
installing O
fake O
certificates O
: OBoth O
WERDLOD S-MAL
and O
OSX_DOK.C S-MAL
are O
designed O
to O
kill O
the O
browser O
process O
before O

While O
WERDLOD S-MAL
kills O
processes O

, O
OSX_DOK.C S-MAL
does O
the O
same O
on O
Safari S-TOOL
, O
Firefox S-TOOL
, O
and O
Chrome S-TOOL
. O

Both O
malware S-MAL
share O
the O
same O
proxy O
settings O
and O
script O
: OWhile O
WERDLOD S-MAL
and O
OSX_DOK.C S-MAL
use O
different O
codes O
( O
since O
they O
target O
different O
operating O
systems O
) O
, O
they O
have O
similar O
proxy O
settings O
and O
script O
formats O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
WERDLOD S-MAL
uses O
scripts O
running O
on O
http://127.0.0.1:5555/#{random_string}.js?ip=#{my_ip} S-URL
as O
proxy O
: OComparing O
it O
to O
OSX_DOK.C S-MAL
, O
we O
can O
see O
that O
it O
uses O
the O
same O
script O
format O
. O

Both O
malware S-MAL
have O
similar O
targets O
. O

Both O
WERDLOD S-MAL
and O
OSX_DOK.C S-MAL
targeted O
financial O
institutions O
, O
with O
a O
particular O
focus O
on O
banks O
in O
Switzerland S-LOC
. O

Further O
analysis O
of O
both O
malware S-MAL
revealed O
that O
their O
main O
targets O
are O
very O
similar O
, O
as O
seen O
in O
the O
screenshot O
below O
. O

While O
it O
’s O
possible O
that O
this O
is O
a O
coincidence O
, O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
evidence O
makes O
it O
unlikely O
for O
these O
two O
malware S-MAL
to O
target O
the O
same O
organizations O
by O
chance O
. O

Given O
the O
connection O
between O
WERDLOD S-MAL
and O
OSX_DOK.C S-MAL
, O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
assume O
that O
the O
latter O
is O
also O
a O
part O
of O
the O
Operational B-ACT
Emmental E-ACT
campaign O
. O

To O
further O
illustrate O
, O
here O
is O
a O
timeline O
of O
Operation B-ACT
Emmental E-ACT
and O
its O
potential O
relationship O
to O
OSX_DOK.C S-MAL
: ODespite O
phishing E-ACT
incidents O
for O
Mac S-OS
devices O
being O
rarer O
than O
their O
Windows S-OS
counterparts O
, O
users O
should O
still O
be O
aware O
that O
attackers O
can O
target O
them O
at O
any O
moment O
. O

By O
implementing O
best O
practices O
for O
phishing-type O
attacks—such O
as O
refraining O
from O
downloading O

unless O
they O
are O
absolutely O
certain O
that O
they O
come O
from O

such O
as O
OSX_DOK.C S-MAL
that O

we O
simply O
dump O
the O

decompress O
it O

We O
discovered O
that O
the B-FILE

was O
obfuscated S-TOOL
using O
.NET B-TOOL

It O
is O
possible O
to O
decompile O
the O
deobfuscated O
sample O
and O
retrieve O
most O

the O
original O

but O
not O
enough O
to O
compile O
it O

After O

After O
decompiling O
the O
sample O

we O
were O
