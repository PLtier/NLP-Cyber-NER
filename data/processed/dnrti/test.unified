Unit B-Organization

believes O
this O
group B-Organization
is O
previously O
unidentified O
and O
therefore O
have O
we O
have O
dubbed O
it O
" O
RANCOR B-Organization
" O
. O

The O
Rancor B-Organization
group I-Organization
's O
attacks O
use O
two O
primary O
malware O
families O
which O
we O
describe O
in O
depth O
later O
in O
this O
blog O
and O
are O
naming O
DDKONG B-System
and O
PLAINTEE B-System
. O

We O
identified O
decoy B-Malware
files I-Malware
which O
indicate O
these O
attacks O
began O
with O
spear B-Vulnerability
phishing I-Vulnerability
messages I-Vulnerability
but O
have O
not O
observed O
the O
actual O
messages O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
Rancor B-Organization
attackers B-Organization
were O
targeting O
political O
entities O
. O

Additionally O
, O
these O
decoy B-Malware
documents I-Malware
are O
hosted O
on O
legitimate O
websites O
including O
a O
government O
website O
belonging O
to O
the O
Cambodia O
Government O
and O
in O
at O
least O
once O
case O
, O
Facebook O
. O

Our O
Investigation O
into O
both O
clusters O
further O
showed O
that O
they O
were O
both O
involved O
in O
attacks O
targeting O
organizations O
in O
South O
East O
Asia O
. O

We O
observed O
DDKONG B-System
in O
use O
between O
February O
2017 O
and O
the O
present O
, O
while O
PLAINTEE B-System
is O
a O
newer O
addition O
with O
the O
earliest O
known O
sample O
being O
observed O
in O
October O
2017 O
. O

The O
RANCOR O
campaign O
represents O
a O
continued O
trend O
of O
targeted O
attacks O
against O
entities O
within O
the O
South O
East O
Asia O
region O
. O

They O
are O
interested O
in O
users O
of O
remote O
banking O
systems O
( O
RBS O
) O
, O
mainly O
in O
Russia O
and O
neighboring O
countries O
. O

That O
this O
group B-Organization
is O
mostly O
targeting O
businesses O
is O
apparent O
from O
the O
processes O
they O
are O
looking O
for O
on O
a O
compromised O
system O
. O

While O
both O
RTM B-System
and O
Buhtrap B-System
are O
looking O
for O
a O
quite O
similar O
process O
list O
, O
the O
infection O
vectors O
are O
quite O
different O
. O

This O
group B-Organization
has O
used O
a O
large O
array O
of O
infection O
vectors O
, O
mostly O
revolving O
around O
drive-by B-Vulnerability
downloads I-Vulnerability
and O
spam B-Vulnerability
. O

They O
are O
both O
targeting O
businesses O
using O
accounting O
software O
, O
are O
fingerprinting O
systems O
of O
interest O
similarly O
, O
are O
looking O
for O
smart O
card O
readers O
, O
and O
finally O
, O
they O
deploy O
an O
array O
of O
malicious O
tools O
to O
spy O
on O
their O
victims O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
we O
will O
focus O
on O
the O
samples O
SHA-1 O
AA0FA4584768CE9E16D67D8C529233E99FF1BBF0 O

. O

Despite O
its O
known O
weaknesses O
, O
the O
RC4 B-System
algorithm O
is O
regularly O
used O

authors O
. O

Based O
on O

the O

we O
have O
grouped O
these O
attacks O
together O
under O
the O
RANCOR O
campaign O
moniker O
. O

Bdo O
is O
the O
Russian O
translation O
for O
RBS O
( O
Remote O

) O
so O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
RBS O
is O
a O
target O
for O
this O
malware O
. O

Other O
groups B-Organization
, O
such O
as O
Buhtrap B-Organization

were O
already O
known O
to O
target O
and O
successfully O
steal O
money O
from O
financial O
institutions O
and O
their O
customers O
in O
Russia O
. O

Our O
research O
on O
the O
RTM B-System

shows O
that O
the O
Russian O

still O
a O

The O
tools O
and O
techniques O
used O
throughout O
these O

are O
consistent O
with O
several O
Chinese O

such O
as O

The O
initial O

The O
most O

The O
malware B-Malware
then O

– O
they O
are O
32 O
and O
64-bit O

We O
recently O
observed O
a O

detected O
roughly O
90 O
phony O
Apple-like O

In O
this O
blog O
we O
provide O
insight O
into O
the O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
(TTPs) O
of O
a O
Brazilian O
cyber O
crime B-Organization
group I-Organization
that O
specializes O
in O
payment O
card O
fraud O
operations O
. O

The O
threat O
actors B-Organization
, O
observed O
by O
FireEye B-Organization
Labs I-Organization
, O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
, O
including O
sharing O
or O
purchasing O
dumps O
online O
, O
hacking O
vulnerable O
merchant O
websites O
and O
compromising B-Vulnerability
payment I-Vulnerability
card I-Vulnerability
processing O
devices O
. O

Once O
in O
their O
possession O
, O
the O
actors B-Organization
use O
these O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
to O
generate O
further O
card O
information O
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
group B-Organization
use O
a O
variety O
of O
tools O
, O
including O
CCleaner B-System
, O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
effectively O
remove O
any O
evidence O
of O
their O
operations O
. O

Another O
common O
step O
taken O
by O
threat O
actors B-Organization
is O
changing B-Vulnerability
their I-Vulnerability
system's I-Vulnerability
MAC O
Address O
to O
avoid O
being O
uniquely O
identified O
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
these O
actors B-Organization
often O
use O
tools O
such O
as O
Technitium B-System
MAC I-System
Address I-System
Changer I-System
. O

We O
have O
observed O
these O
actors B-Organization
using O
Tor B-System
or O
proxy-based B-System
tools I-System
similar O
to O
Tor O
(e.g O
, O
UltraSurf O
, O
as O
seen O
in O
Figure O
2) O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
them B-Malware
using O
virtual O
private O
network O
services O
that O
use O
IPs O
based O
in O
numerous O
countries O
to O
ensure O
anonymity O
and O
obfuscate O
criminal O
operations O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
observations O
, O
this O
group B-Organization
uses O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
. O

Payment O
card O
dumps O
are O
commonly O
shared O
amongst O
Brazilian O
threat O
actors B-Organization
via O
social O
media O
forums O
such O
as O
Facebook O
, O
Skype O
, O
and O
web-based O
WhatsApp O
messenger O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
group B-Organization
takes O
advantage O
of O
freely O
available O
consolidations O
of O
email B-System
credentials I-System
, O
personal B-System
information I-System
, O
and O
other O
data O
shared O
in O
eCrime O
forums O
for O
fraud O
purposes O
. O

These O
actors B-Organization
scan O
websites O
for O
vulnerabilities O
to O
exploit O
to O
illicitly O
access O
databases O
. O

They B-Organization
most O
commonly O
target O
Brazilian O
merchants O
, O
though O
others O
use O
the O
same O
tactics O
to O
exploit O
entities O
outside O
Brazil O
. O

The O
group B-Organization
also O
uses O
the O
SQL B-System
injection I-System
(SQLi) O
tools O
Havij O
Advanced O
SQL O
Injection O
Tool O
and O
SQLi O
Dumper O
version O
7.0 O
(Figure O
4) O
to O
scan O
for O
and O
exploit O
vulnerabilities O
in O
targeted O
eCommerce O
sites O
. O

At O
least O
eight O
sellers B-Organization
update O
the O
website O
as O
frequently O
as O
daily O
, O
offering O
newly O
obtained O
databases O
from O
the O
U.S O
. O

Once O
in O
possession O
of O
compromised O
payment O
card B-System
credentials I-System
, O
these O
actors B-Organization
use O
tools O
commonly O
known O
as O
card O
generators O
to O
generate O
new O
card O
numbers O
based O
on O
the O
compromised O
ones O
, O
creating O
additional O
opportunities O
for O
monetization O
. O

One O
bulk B-System
card-checking I-System
tool O
this O
group B-Organization
uses O
is O
Testador O
Amazon.com O
v1.1 O
(Figure O
8). O
its O
name O
, O
this O
tool O
does O
not O
use O
Amazon’s O
website O
, O
but O
exploits O
an O
unauthenticated O
Cross-Site O
Request O
Forgery O
(CSRF) O
vulnerability O
of O
a O
merchant O
website O
allowing O
the O
abuse O
of O
PayPal B-System
Payflow I-System
link O
functionality O
(Figure O

. O

Based O
on O
our O
observations O
of O
interactions O
in O
this O
channel O
, O
between O
May O
2016 O
and O
June O
2016 O
, O
malicious O
actors B-Organization
validated O
2 O
, O
987 O
cards O
from O
62 O
countries O
, O
with O
the O
most O
coming O
from O
the O
U.S. O
(nearly O
half) O
, O
Brazil O
, O
and O
France O
. O

The O
actors B-Organization
frequently O
use O
the O
stolen O
data O
to O
create O
cloned O
physical O
cards O
, O
which O
they O
use O
to O
attempt O
to O
withdraw O
funds O
from O
ATMs O
. O

The O
group B-Organization
primarily O
uses O
the O
MSR B-System
606 I-System
Software I-System
(Figure O
12) O
and O
Hardware B-System
(Figure O
13) O
to O
create O
cloned O
cards O
. O

However O
, O
Brazilian O
actors B-Organization
commonly O
use O
several O
methods O
to O
do O
so O
, O
such O
as O
reselling O
cards O
they O
have O
created O
, O
paying O
bills O
with O
stolen O
cards O
in O
return O
for O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
bill's O
value O
and O
reselling O
illicitly O
obtained O
goods O
. O

Some O
attacker B-Organization
tools O
were O
used O
to O
almost O
exclusively O
target O
organizations O
within O
APAC O
. O

In O
April O
2015 O
, O
we O
uncovered O
the O
malicious O
efforts O
of O
APT30 B-Organization
, O
a O
suspected O
China-based O
threat O
group O
that O
has O
exploited O
the O
networks O
of O
governments O
and O
organizations O
across O
the O
region O
, O
targeting O
highly O
sensitive O
political O
, O
economic O
and O
military O
information O
. O

The O
individuals B-Organization
using O
Hancitor B-System
malware O
also O
known O
by O
the O
name O
Chanitor B-System
are O
no O
exception O
and O
have O
taken O
three O
approaches O
to O
deliver O
the O
malware O
in O
order O
to O
ultimately O
steal O
data O
from O
their O
victims O
. O

We O
recently O
observed O
Hancitor B-Organization
attacks O
against O
some O
of O
our O
FireEye B-Organization
Exploit O
Guard O
customers O
. O

The O
group B-Organization
has O
performed O
these O
activities O
at O
multiple O
locations O
across O
Brazil O
, O
possibly O
using O
multiple O
mules O
. O

Once O
downloaded O
and O
executed O
, O
it O
drops O
an O
intermediate O
payload O
that O
further O
downloads O
a O
Pony B-Malware
DLL I-Malware
and O
Vawtrak B-Malware
executable O
, O
which O
perform O
data O
theft O
and O
connect O
to O
a O
command O
and O
control O
(C2) O
server O
. O

The O

in O
these O
emails O
is O
a O

. O

After O
the O

is O
executed O
, O
it O
downloads O
Pony B-Malware
and O
Vawtrak B-Malware
malware O
variants O
to O
steal O

. O

Upon O
execution O
, O
it O
will O

In O
this O
blog O
, O
FireEye B-Organization
Labs O
dissects O
this O
new O
ATM B-Malware
malware I-Malware
that O
we O
have O
dubbed O
RIPPER B-Malware
(due O
to O
the O
project O
name O
ATMRIPPER” O
identified O
in O
the O
sample) O
and O
documents O
indicators O
that O
strongly O
suggest O
this O
piece O
of O
malware O
is O
the O
one O
used O
to O
steal O
from O
the O
ATMs O
at O
banks O
in O
Thailand O
. O

RIPPER B-Malware
interacts O
with O
the O
ATM O
by O
inserting O
a O
specially O
manufactured O
ATM O
card O
with O
an O
EMV O
chip O
that O
serves O
as O
the O
authentication O
mechanism O
. O

RIPPER B-Malware
will O
examine O
the O
contents O
of O
directories O
associated O
with O
the O
targeted O
ATM O
vendors O
and O
will O
replace O
legitimate O
executables O
with O
itself O
. O

Once O
a O
valid O
card O
with O
a O
malicious O
EMV O
chip O
is O
detected O
, O
RIPPER B-Malware
will O
instantiate O
a O

has O
been O
operating O
since O
at O

is O
primarily O

From O
mid-2017 O
to O
mid-2018 O
, O
Whitefly B-Organization
launched O
targeted O
attacks O
against O
multiple O
organizations O
. O

While O
most O
of O
these O
organizations O
were O
based O
in O
Singapore O
, O
some O
were O
multinational O
organizations O
with O
a O
presence O
in O
Singapore O
. O

To O
date O
, O
Whitefly B-Organization
has O
attacked O
organizations O
in O
the O
healthcare O
, O
media O
, O
telecommunications O
, O
and O
engineering O
sectors O
. O

Whitefly B-Organization
first O
infects O
its O
victims O
using O
a O
dropper B-System
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
malicious.exe B-Malware
or O
.dll B-Malware
file I-Malware
that O
is O
disguised O
as O
a O
document O
or O

. O

If O
opened O
, O
the O
dropper B-System
runs O
a O
loader O
known O
as O
Trojan.Vcrodat B-System
on O
the O
computer O
. O

Whitefly B-Organization
has O
consistently O
used O
a O
technique O
known O
as O
search B-System
order I-System
hijacking I-System
to O
run O
Vcrodat B-System
. O

Once O
executed O
, O
Vcrodat B-System
loads O
an O
encrypted O
payload O
on O
to O
the O
victim O

computer O
. O

Whitefly B-Organization
rely O
heavily O
on O
tools O
such O
as O
Mimikatz B-System
to O
obtain O
credentials O
. O

Using O
these O
credentials B-System
, O
the O
attackers O
are O
able O
to O
compromise O
more O
machines O
on O
the O
network O
and O
, O
from O
those O
machines O
, O
again O
obtain O
more O
credentials O
. O

Whitefly B-Organization
usually O
attempts O
to O
remain O
within O
a O
targeted O
organization O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time—often O
months—in O
order O
to O
steal O
large O
volumes O
of O
information O
. O

In O
order O
to O
carry O
out O
this O
operation O
, O
it O
uses O
publicly B-System
available I-System
tools I-System
, O
including O
Mimikatz B-System
( O
Hacktool.Mimikatz B-System
) O
and O
an O
open-source O
tool O
that O
exploits O
a O
known O
Windows O
privilege O

( O
CVE-2016-0051 O
) O
on O
unpatched O
computers O
. O

Like O
Vcrodat B-System
, O
Nibatad B-System
is O
also O
a O
loader O
that O
leverages O
search O

hijacking O
, O
and O
downloads O
an O
encrypted O

to O
the O
infected O
computer O
. O

Why O
Whitefly B-Organization
uses O
these O
two O
different O
loaders B-System
in O
some O
of O
its O
attacks O
remains O
unknown O
. O

While O
Vcrodat B-System
is O
delivered O

the O
malicious O

, O
we O
have O
yet O
to O
discover O
how O
Nibatad B-System
is O
delivered O
to O
the O
