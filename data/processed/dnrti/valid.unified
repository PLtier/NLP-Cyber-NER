In O

PLATINUM B-Organization
uses O
a O

The O
PLATINUM B-Organization

a O
few O
different O

perform O
their O

most O
likely O
to O
take O

of O
different O

While O
one O
family O
relies O
on O
a O
small O
number O
of O

the O
other O
delves O

that O

under O
steady O
development O

In O
August O
2017 O
, O
a O
new O

reported O
to O
have O

with O
a O

The O
targeting O

an O

rather O

the O

, O
made O
BitPaymer B-System
stand O
out O

at O
the O
time O

Though O
the O
encryption O

functionality O
of O
BitPaymer B-System
was O
not O
technically O
sophisticated O
, O
the O
malware O
contained O
multiple O
anti-analysis O
features O
that O
overlapped O
with O
Dridex B-System

Later O
technical O
analysis O
of O
BitPaymer B-System
indicated O
that O
it O
had O
been O
developed O
by O
INDRIK B-Organization
SPIDER I-Organization
, O
suggesting O
the O
group O
had O
expanded O
its O
criminal O
operation O
to O
include O

as O
a O
monetization O
strategy O
. O

The O
beginning O
of O

also O
brought O
a O
turning O
point O
in O
INDRIK B-Organization
SPIDER I-Organization

operation O

CrowdStrike® B-Organization

also O
observed O
a O

During O
incidents O
that O

installed O
on O
the O
victim O

prior O
to O
the O

of O
the O

Also O
unusual O
was O
the O
observation O
that O
both O

Though O
there O

INDRIK O

It O
was O

during O

that O
INDRIK O
SPIDER O
is O
not O
willing O
to O

on O
the O

explicitly O

that O
the O

can O
use O
multiple O
Bitcoin O

obtain O
the O

based O
on O
the O

INDRIK B-Organization

The O

the O

in O

Dridex B-System

in O
less O

in O

, O
and O
BitPaymer B-System

began O
in O

There O

In O

The O

Recently O
, O
FireEye B-Organization
released O
a O
great O
report O
on O
one O
of O
the O
more O
active O
groups O
, O
now O
known O
as O
APT30 B-Organization
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Kaspersky B-Organization
discovered O
that O
the O
Winnti B-Organization
group O
uses O
a O
popular O
backdoor O
known O
as O
PlugX B-System
which O
also O
has O
Chinese O

Previous O
work O

vendor O
FireEye B-Organization
in O
October O
2014 O
suggests O
APT28 B-Organization
might O
be O
of O
Russian O
origin O
. O

After O
publishing O
our O
initial O
series O
of O
blogposts O
back O
in O
2016 O
, O
Kaspersky B-Organization
has O
continued O
to O
track O
the O
ScarCruft B-Organization
threat O
actor O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
ScarCruft’s B-Organization
recent O
activities O
, O
Kaspersky B-Organization
strongly O
believes O
that O
this O
ScarCruft B-Organization
group O
is O
likely O
to O
continue O
to O
evolve O
. O

Kaspersky B-Organization
also O
discovered O
an O
interesting O
piece O
of O
rare O
malware O
created O
by O
this O
threat O
actor O
ScarCruft B-Organization
. O

Kaspersky B-Organization
witnessed O
the O
ScarCruft B-Organization
threat O
actor O
extensively O
testing O
a O

for O
the O

Based O
on O

, O
Kaspersky B-Organization

procedure O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Kaspersky B-Organization
analyzed O
the O
victims O
of O
this O
campaign O
and O
spotted O
an O
interesting O
overlap O
of O
this O
campaign O
with O
another O
APT O
actor O
known O
as O
DarkHotel B-Organization

Secureworks B-Organization

investigated O
activities O
associated O

BUTLER I-Organization
(also O

, O
which O
likely O
originates O
in O
the O
People O
. O

However O
, O
an O
investigation O
by O
Symantec B-Organization
has O
found O
that O
Butterfly B-Organization
has O
been O
active O
since O
at O

March O
2012 O
and O
its O

have O
not O

continued O
to O
the O

day O
, O

have O
also O
increased O
in O

. O

Talos B-Organization
assesses O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
Group B-Organization
123 I-Organization

As O

Last O
