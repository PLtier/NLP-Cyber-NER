Over O
5 O
years O
ago O
, O
we O
began O
tracking O
a O
new O
campaign O
that O
we O
called O
FakeUpdates O
( O
also O
known O
as O
SocGholish O
) O
that O
used O
compromised O
websites O
to O
trick O
users O
into O
running O
a O
fake O
browser O
update O
. O

Instead O
, O
victims O
would O
end O
up O
infecting O
their O
computers O
with O
the O
NetSupport B-System
RAT I-System
, O
allowing O
threat B-Organization
actors I-Organization
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
and O
deliver O
additional O
payloads O
. O

As O
we O
have O
seen O
over O
the O
years O
, O
SocGholish O
is O
an O
established O
player O
that O
has O
managed O
to O
compromise O
countless O
victims O
and O
deliver O
ransomware O
after O
facilitating O
the O
installation O
of O
tools O
like O
Cobalt B-System
Strike I-System
or O
Mimikatz B-System
. O

Now O
, O
there O
is O
a O
potential O
new O
competitor O
in O
the O
" O
fake O
updates O
" O
landscape O
that O
looks O
strangely O
familiar O
. O

The O
new O
campaign O
, O
which O
we O
call O
FakeSG O
, O
also O
relies O
on O
hacked O
WordPress O
websites O
to O
display O
a O
custom O
landing O
page O
mimicking O
the O
victim O
's O
browser O
. O

The O
threat B-Organization
actors I-Organization
are O
distributing O
NetSupport B-System
RAT I-System
either O
as O
a O
zipped O
download O
or O
via O
an O
Internet O
shortcut O
. O

While O
FakeSG O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
newcomer O
, O
it O
uses O
different O
layers O
of O
obfuscation O
and O
delivery O
techniques O
that O
make O
it O
a O
threat O
to O
take O
seriously O
and O
which O
could O
potentially O
rival O
with O
SocGholish O
. O

We O
first O
heard O
of O
this O
new O
campaign O
thanks O
to O
a O
Mastodon B-Organization
post O
by O
Randy B-Organization
McEoin I-Organization
. O

The O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
are O
very O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
SocGholish O
and O
it O
would O
be O
easy O
to O
think O
the O
two O
are O
related O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
chain O
also O
leads O
to O
NetSupport B-System
RAT I-System
. O

However O
, O
the O
template O
source O
code O
is O
quite O
different O
and O
the O
payload O
delivery O
uses O
different O
infrastructure O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
call O
this O
variant O
FakeSG O
. O

simply O

the O

came O
out O

Regardless O

something O
our O

which O
is O
used O

. O

We O
called O
this O
new O
malware B-Malware
? O

ItaDuke B-Malware
because O
it O
reminded O
us O
of O

Since O
the O
original O
announcement O
, O
we O
have O
observed O
several O
new O

using O
the O
same O
exploit O
( O
CVE-2013 B-Vulnerability

The O
MiniDuke B-Organization
attackers I-Organization
are O
still O
active O
at O
this O
time O
and O
have O
created O
malware O
as O
recently O
as O
February O
20 O
, O
2013 O
. O

To O
compromise O
the O
victims O
, O
the O
attackers O
used O
extremely O
effective O
social O
engineering O
techniques O
which O
involved O
sending O
malicious O
PDF O
documents O
to O
their O
targets O
. O

The O
PDFs O
were O
highly O
relevant O
and O
well O
- O
crafted O
content O
that O
fabricated O
human O
rights O
seminar O
information O
( O
ASEM O
) O
and O
Ukraine O
- O
s O
foreign O
policy O
and O
NATO O
membership O
plans O
. O

These O
malicious B-Malware
PDF I-Malware
files I-Malware
were O
rigged O
with O
exploits O
attacking O
Adobe B-System
Reader I-System
versions I-System
9 I-System
, I-System
10 I-System
and I-System
11 I-System
, O
bypassing O
its O
sandbox O
. O

Once O
the O
system O
is O
exploited O
, O
a O
very O
small O
downloader O
is O
dropped O
onto O
the O
victim O
- O
s O
disc O
that O
- O
s O
only O
20 O
KB O
in O
size O
. O

This O
downloader O
is O
unique O
per O
system O
and O
contains O
a O
customized O
backdoor O
written O
in O
Assembler O
. O

When O
loaded O
at O
system O
boot O
, O
the O
downloader O
uses O
a O
set O
of O
mathematical O
calculations O
to O
determine O
the O
computer O
- O
s O
unique O
fingerprint O
, O
and O
in O
turn O
uses O
this O
data O
to O
uniquely O
encrypt O
its O
communications O
later O
. O

If O
the O
target O
system O
meets O
the O
pre O
- O
defined O
requirements O
, O
the O
malware O
will O
use O
Twitter O
( O
unbeknownst O
to O
the O
user O
) O
and O
start O
looking O
for O
specific O
tweets O
from O
pre O
- O
made O
accounts O
. O

These O
accounts O
were O
created O
by O
MiniDuke O
- O
s O
Command O
and O
Control O
( O
C2 O
) O
operators O
and O
the O
tweets O
maintain O
specific O
tags O
labeling O
encrypted O
URLs O
for O
the O
backdoors O
. O

These O
URLs O
provide O
access O
to O
the O
C2s O
, O
which O
then O
provide O
potential O
commands O
and O
encrypted O
transfers O
of O
additional O
backdoors O
onto O
the O
system O
via O
GIF O
files O
. O

• O
Based O
on O
the O
analysis O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
MiniDuke B-Organization
- I-Organization
s I-Organization
creators I-Organization
provide O
a O
dynamic O
backup O
system O
that O
also O
can O
fly O
under O
the O
radar O
– O
if O
Twitter B-Organization
isn O
- O
t O
working O
or O
the O
accounts O
are O
down O
, O
the O
malware B-Malware
can O
use O
Google B-Organization
Search O
to O
find O
the O
encrypted O
strings O
to O
the O
next O
C2 O
. O

This O
model O
is O
flexible O
and O
enables O
the O
operators O
to O
constantly O
change O
how O
their O
backdoors O
retrieve O
further O
commands O
or O
malcode O
as O
needed O
. O

Once O
the O
infected O
system O
locates O
the O
C2 B-System
, O
it O
receives O
encrypted O
backdoors O
that O
are O
obfuscated O
within O
GIF O
files O
and O
disguised O
as O
pictures O
that O
appear O
on O
a O
victim O
- O
s O
machine O
. O

Once O
they O
are O
downloaded O
to O
the O
machine O
, O
they O
can O
fetch O
a O
larger O
backdoor O
which O
carries O
out O
the O
cyberespionage O
activities O
, O
through O
functions O
such O
as O
copy O

, O
move O

kill O
process O
and O
of O
course O
, O
download O
and O
execute O
new O
malware O
and O
lateral O
movement O
tools O
. O

The O
final O
stage O
backdoor O
connects O
to O
two O
servers O
, O
one O
in O
Panama O
and O
one O
in O
Turkey O
to O
receive O
the O

previously O
recommended O

updating O

provide O
a O
basic O
level O
of O

Researchers B-Organization
have O
uncovered O
an O
ongoing O
cyberespionage O
campaign O
targeting O
more O
than O
30 O
online O

companies O
over O
the O
past O
four O

The O

called O

They O

according O
to O
a O
release O
published O
Thursday O
by O
researchers O
from O
antivirus B-Organization
provider I-Organization
Kaspersky B-Organization

The O
attackers B-Organization
work O
from O
computers B-System
with I-System
Chinese I-System
and I-System
Korean I-System

They O
used O
their O
unauthorized O

obtain O
digital O

that O
were O
later O
exploited O
in O
malware O
campaigns O
targeting O
other O
industries O
and O
political O
activists O
. O

So O
far O
, O
there O
's O
no O
evidence O
that O
customers O
of O
the O
infected O
game O
companies O
were O
targeted O
, O
although O
in O
at O

one O
case O
, O
malicious B-Malware

was O
accidentally O
installed O

by O
one O

Kaspersky B-Organization
said O
there O
was O
another O

by O
the B-Malware
malware I-Malware
, O
which O
is O
known O
as O

" O

" O
Having O
infected O

that O
do O
business O
in O

, O
the O
attackers B-Organization
potentially O
get O
access O
to O
millions O
of O
users O
, O
" O
the O
researchers O
wrote O
. O

" O
So O
far O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
data O
that O
the O
attackers O
stole O
from O
common O
users O
but O
we O
do O
have O
at O
least O
two O
incidents O
when O
Winnti B-Malware
malware I-Malware
had O
been O
planted O
on O
an O
online O
game O

and O

The O
samples O
we O
have O
observed O
seemed O
not O
to O
be O

but O
a B-Malware
malware I-Malware
module I-Malware
which O
accidentally O
got O

the O

wrong O
place O
. O

But O
a O
potential O
of O
attackers B-Organization
to O
misuse O
such O
access O
to O
infect O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
Internet O

creates O
a O
great O
risk O
. O
" O

Digital B-System

have O
been O

that O
targeted O

The B-System
cryptographic I-System

have O
also O
been O
exploited O
in O

that O
have O
hit O

to O
prevent O
the O

In O
addition O
to O
stealing O
digital O
certificates O
, O
the O
Winnti O
gang O

campaign O
appears O
to O
be O
motivated O
by O
the O
desire O
to O
manipulate O

such O
as O

that O

in O
many O
cases O
be O
converted O

The O
attackers B-Organization
may O
also O
want O
to O
use O

Recently O
, O
this O
model O
for O
threat B-Organization
actors I-Organization
has O
come O
to O
be O
known O
as O
the O
“ O
as O
- O
a O

service O
" O
model O
, O
borrowing O
the O
term O
from O
the O
growing O
trend O
in O
the O
tech O
industry O
. O

Ransomware O
- O
as O
- O
a O
- O
service O
is O
a O
relatively O
new O
version O
of O
these O
commodity O
groups O
, O
such O
as O
DarkSide B-Organization
, O
known O
for O
the O
cyber O
attack O
in O
2021 O
that O
disrupted O
the O
Colonial O
oil O
pipeline O
and O
made O
gas O
more O
expensive O
for O
thousands O
of O
U.S. O
consumers O
. O

But O
other O
bad B-Organization
actors I-Organization
have O
since O
adopted O
this O
businesses O
model O
, O
offering O
every O
from O
command B-System
and I-System
control I-System
servers I-System
to O
phishing O
bots O
- O
as O

a O

service O
. O

There O
are O
a O
few O
reasons O
why O
attackers B-Organization
may O
opt O
to O
pay O
for O
an B-System
as I-System
- I-System
a I-System

service I-System
malware I-System
tool I-System
for O
their O
chosen O

As O

time O

When O
they O
pay O
for O
someone O
else O
’s O
malware O
kit O
, O
whether O
it O
be O
ransomware O
or O
a O
phishing O
bot O
, O
they O
do O
n’t O
have O
to O
invest O
time O
, O
money O
or O
labor O
to O
write O
their O
own O
malicious O
code O
or O
tools O
and O
instead O
can O
hop O
right O
into O
deploying O
the O
malware O
. O

For O
the O
actors B-Organization
and O
groups O
who O
originally O
created O
the O
malware O
, O
it O
is O
a O
more O
reliable O
income O
stream O
for O
them O
. O

Usually O
, O
they O
’d O
have O
to O
hope O
a O
successful O
attack O
leads O
to O
a O
ransom O
payment O
or O
some O
sort O
of O
other O
financial O
windfall O

Instead O
, O
they O
can O
make O
money O
by O

to O
other O
bad O

for O
a O
fee O

Bad B-Organization

Over O
5 O
years O
ago O
, O
we O
began O
tracking O
a O
new O
campaign O
that O
we O
called O
FakeUpdates B-Malware
( O
also O
known O
as O
SocGholish B-Malware
) O
that O
used O
compromised O
websites O
to O
trick O
users O
into O
running O
a O
fake O
browser O
update O
. O

Instead O
, O
victims O
would O
end O
up O
infecting O
their O
computers O
with O
the O
NetSupport B-System
RAT I-System
, O
allowing O
threat O
actors O
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
and O
deliver O
additional O
payloads O
. O

As O
we O
have O
seen O
over O
the O
years O
, O
SocGholish B-Malware
is O
an O
established O
player O
that O
has O
managed O
to O
compromise O
countless O
victims O
and O
deliver O
ransomware O
after O
facilitating O
the O
installation O
of O
tools O
like O
Cobalt B-System
Strike I-System
or O
Mimikatz B-System
. O

The O
new O
campaign O
, O
which O
we O
call O
FakeSG B-Malware
, O
also O
relies O
on O
hacked B-System
WordPress I-System
websites I-System
to O
display O
a O
custom O
landing O
page O
mimicking O
the O
victim O
's O
browser O
. O

The O
threat B-Organization
actors I-Organization
are O
distributing O
NetSupport B-System
RAT I-System
either O
as O
a O
zipped O
download O
or O
via O
an O
Internet O
shortcut O
. O

While O
FakeSG B-Malware
appears O
to O
be O
a O
newcomer O
, O
it O
uses O
different O
layers O
of O
obfuscation O
and O
delivery O
techniques O
that O
make O
it O
a O
threat O
to O
take O
seriously O
and O
which O
could O
potentially O
rival O
with O
SocGholish B-Malware
. O

We O
first O
heard O
of O
this O
new O
campaign O
thanks O
to O
a O
Mastodon B-Organization
post O
by O
Randy B-Organization
McEoin I-Organization
. O

The O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
are O
very O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
SocGholish B-Malware
and O
it O
would O
be O
easy O
to O
think O
the O
two O
are O
related O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
chain O
also O
leads O
to O
NetSupport B-System
RAT I-System
. O

As O
a O

, O
we O
decided O
to O
call O
this O
variant O

Over O
5 O
years O
ago O
, O
we O
began O
tracking O
a O
new O
campaign O
that O
we O
called O
FakeUpdates O
( O
also O
known O
as O
SocGholish O
) O
that O
used O
compromised O
websites O
to O
trick O
users O
into O
running O
a O
fake O
browser O
update O
. O

Instead O
, O
victims O
would O
end O
up O
infecting O
their O
computers O
with O
the O
NetSupport B-System
RAT I-System
, O
allowing O
threat B-Organization
actors I-Organization
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
and O
deliver O
additional O
payloads O
. O

As O
we O
have O
seen O
over O
the O
years O
, O
SocGholish O
is O
an O
established O
player O
that O
has O
managed O
to O
compromise O
countless O
victims O
and O
deliver O
ransomware O
after O
facilitating O
the O
installation O
of O
tools O
like O
Cobalt B-System
Strike I-System
or O
Mimikatz B-System
. O

Now O
, O
there O
is O
a O
potential O
new O
competitor O
in O
the O
" O
fake O
updates O
" O
landscape O
that O
looks O
strangely O
familiar O
. O

The O
new O
campaign O
, O
which O
we O
call O
FakeSG O
, O
also O
relies O
on O
hacked O
WordPress O
websites O
to O
display O
a O
custom O
landing O
page O
mimicking O
the O
victim O
's O
browser O
. O

The O
threat B-Organization
actors I-Organization
are O
distributing O
NetSupport B-System
RAT I-System
either O
as O
a O
zipped O
download O
or O
via O
an O
Internet O
shortcut O
. O

While O
FakeSG O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
newcomer O
, O
it O
uses O
different O
layers O
of O
obfuscation O
and O
delivery O
techniques O
that O
make O
it O
a O
threat O
to O
take O
seriously O
and O
which O
could O
potentially O
rival O
with O
SocGholish O
. O

We O
first O
heard O
of O
this O
new O
campaign O
thanks O
to O
a O
Mastodon B-Organization
post O
by O
Randy B-Organization
McEoin I-Organization
. O

The O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
are O
very O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
SocGholish O
and O
it O
would O
be O
easy O
to O
think O
the O
two O
are O
related O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
chain O
also O
leads O
to O
NetSupport B-System
RAT I-System
. O

However O
, O
the O
template O
source O
code O
is O
quite O
different O
and O
the O
payload O
delivery O
uses O
different O
infrastructure O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
call O
this O
variant O
FakeSG O
. O

simply O

The O

are O
still O

at O
this O
time O
and O
have O
created O
malware O
as O
recently O
as O
February O
20 O
, O
2013 O
. O

To O
compromise O
the O
victims O
, O
the O
attackers O
used O
extremely O
effective O
social O
engineering O
techniques O
which O
involved O
sending O
malicious O
PDF O
documents O
to O
their O
targets O
. O

The O
PDFs O
were O
highly O
relevant O
and O
well O
- O
crafted O
content O
that O
fabricated O
human O

( O

Ukraine O

These O
malicious B-Malware
PDF I-Malware

were O
rigged O
with O
exploits O
attacking O
Adobe B-System
Reader I-System
versions I-System
9 I-System
, I-System
10 I-System
and I-System
11 I-System
, O
bypassing O
its O
sandbox O
. O

Once O
the O
system O
is O
exploited O
, O
a O
very O
small O
downloader O
is O
dropped O
onto O
the O
victim O
- O
s O
disc O
that O
- O
s O
only O
20 O
KB O
in O
size O
. O

This O
downloader O
is O
unique O
per O
system O
and O
contains O
a O
customized O
backdoor O
written O
in O
Assembler O
. O

When O
loaded O
at O
system O
boot O
, O
the O
downloader O
uses O
a O
set O
of O
mathematical O
calculations O
to O
determine O
the O
computer O
- O
s O
unique O
fingerprint O
, O
and O
in O
turn O
uses O
this O
data O
to O
uniquely O
encrypt O
its O
communications O
later O
. O

If O
the O
target O
system O
meets O
the O
pre O
- O
defined O
requirements O
, O
the O
malware O
will O
use O
Twitter O
( O
unbeknownst O
to O
the O
user O
) O
and O
start O
looking O
for O
specific O
tweets O
from O
pre O
- O
made O
accounts O
. O

These O
accounts O
were O
created O
by O
MiniDuke O
- O
s O
Command O
and O
Control O
( O
C2 O
) O
operators O
and O
the O
tweets O
maintain O
specific O
tags O
labeling O
encrypted O
URLs O
for O
the O
backdoors O
. O

These O
URLs O
provide O
access O
to O
the O
C2s O
, O
which O
then O
provide O
potential O
commands O
and O
encrypted O
transfers O
of O
additional O
backdoors O
onto O
the O
system O
via O
GIF O
files O
. O

• O
Based O
on O
the O
analysis O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
MiniDuke B-Organization
- I-Organization
s I-Organization
creators I-Organization
provide O
a O
dynamic O
backup O
system O
that O
also O
can O
fly O
under O
the O
radar O
– O
if O
Twitter B-Organization
isn O
- O
t O
working O
or O
the O
accounts O
are O
down O
, O
the O
malware B-Malware
can O
use O
Google B-Organization
Search O
to O
find O
the O
encrypted O
strings O
to O
the O
next O
C2 O
. O

This O
model O
is O
flexible O
and O
enables O
the O
operators O
to O
constantly O
change O
how O
their O
backdoors O
retrieve O
further O
commands O
or O
malcode O
as O
needed O
. O

Once O
the O
infected O
system O
locates O
the O
C2 B-System
, O
it O
receives O
encrypted O
backdoors O
that O
are O
obfuscated O
within O
GIF O
files O
and O
disguised O
as O
pictures O
that O
appear O
on O
a O
victim O
- O
s O
machine O
. O

Once O
they O
are O
downloaded O
to O
the O
machine O
, O
they O
can O
fetch O
a O
larger O
backdoor O
which O
carries O
out O
the O
cyberespionage O
activities O

and O
execute O

and O

The O

also O
in O

according O
to O
a O
release O
published O
Thursday O
by O
researchers O
from O
antivirus B-Organization
provider I-Organization
Kaspersky B-Organization
Lab I-Organization
. O

The O
attackers B-Organization
work O
from O
computers B-System
with I-System
Chinese I-System
and I-System
Korean I-System
language I-System
configurations I-System
. O

They O
used O
their O
unauthorized O
access O
to O
obtain O
digital O
certificates O
that O
were O
later O
exploited O
in O
malware O
campaigns O
targeting O
other O
industries O
and O
political O
activists O
. O

So O
far O
, O
there O
's O
no O
evidence O
that O
customers O
of O
the O
infected O
game O
companies O
were O
targeted O
, O
although O
in O
at O
least O
one O
case O
, O
malicious B-Malware
code I-Malware
was O
accidentally O
installed O
on O
gamers O
' O
computers O
by O
one O
of O
the B-Organization
infected I-Organization
victim I-Organization
companies I-Organization
. O

Kaspersky B-Organization
said O
there O
was O
another O
case O
of O
end O
users O
being O
infected O
by O
the B-Malware
malware I-Malware
, O
which O
is O
known O
as O
" O
Winnti B-Malware
. O
" O

" O
Having O
infected O
gaming O
companies O
that O
do O
business O
in O
MMORPG O
, O
the O
attackers B-Organization
potentially O
get O
access O
to O
millions O
of O
users O
, O
" O
the O
researchers O
wrote O
. O

" O
So O
far O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
data O
that O
the O
attackers O
stole O
from O
common O
users O
but O
we O
do O
have O
at O
least O
two O
incidents O
when O
Winnti B-Malware
malware I-Malware
had O
been O
planted O
on O
an O
online O
game O
update O
server O
and O

The O
samples O
we O
have O
observed O
seemed O
not O
to O
be O
malware B-Malware
targeted O
for O
the O
game O
fans O
but O
a B-Malware
malware I-Malware
module I-Malware
which O
accidentally O
got O
into O
[ O
the O
] O
wrong O
place O
. O

But O
a O
potential O
of O
attackers B-Organization
to O
misuse O
such O
access O
to O
infect O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
Internet O
users O
creates O
a O
great O
risk O
. O
" O

Digital B-System
certificates I-System
stolen O
in O
some O
of O
the O
heists O
have O
been O
used O
to O
sign O
malware O
that O
targeted O
Tibetan O
and O
Uyghur O
activists O
. O

The B-System
cryptographic I-System
certificates I-System
have O
also O
been O
exploited O
in O
attacks O
that O
have O
hit O
companies O
in O
the O
aerospace O
industry O
. O

Attackers B-Organization
frequently O
abuse O
stolen O
certificates O
to O
prevent O
the O
malware O
they O
're O
spreading O
from O
being O
detected O
by O
various O
security O
protections O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
stealing O
digital O
certificates O
, O
the O
Winnti O
gang O
's O
campaign O
appears O
to O
be O
motivated O
by O
the O
desire O
to O
manipulate O
in O
- O
game O
currency O
, O
such O
as O
" O
runes O
" O
or O
" O
gold O
, O
" O
that O
can O
in O
many O
cases O
be O
converted O
into O
real O
currency O
. O

The O
attackers B-Organization
may O
also O
want O
to O
use O
source O
code O
stolen O
from O
the O
game O
companies O
so O
it O
can O
be O
deployed O
in O
rogue O

offering O

model O
for O
a O
decade O
- O
plus O
, O
originally O
known O
as O
commodity B-Malware

This O
is O
when O

create O
a B-System
suite I-System
of I-System

tools I-System
and O
offer O
them O
up O
for O

It O
can O
range O

for O

to O

Recently O

this O

has O
come O
to O
be O
known O

borrowing O
the O

known O
for O
the O

in O

that O
disrupted O
the O
Colonial O

and O
made O

more O
expensive O
for O
thousands O
of O

. O

But O
other O
bad B-Organization

have O

There O
are O
a O
few O
reasons O
why O

may O
opt O
to O

for O

, O
whether O
it O

, O
they O
do O

money O

to O
write O
their O
own O
malicious O
code O

and O
instead O
can O
hop O
right O
into O
deploying O
the O
malware O
. O

For O
the O
actors B-Organization
and O
groups O
who O
originally O
created O
the O
malware O
, O
it O
is O
a O
more O
reliable O
income O
stream O
for O
them O
. O

Usually O
, O
they O
’d O
have O
to O
hope O
a O
successful O

leads O
to O
a O
ransom O
payment O
or O
some O

of O

One O
might O
think O
we O
could O
have O
updated O
the O

only O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
CSP B-System
does O
n't O
support O

( O
See O
Spec O

Having O
such O
a O
gap O
with O
the O
most O
commonly O
used O
domain O
allowed O
with O
CSP B-System
is O
a O
major O

the O

that O
can O
come O
from O
other O

used O

A O
possible O
solution O
would O
come O
from O

adding O
the O

the O

subdomain O
to O

set O

A O
more O
granular O
future O
direction O
for O
strengthening O

direction O
to O
consider O
as O
part O
of O
the O
CSP O
standard O
is O
XHR O
proxy O

This O
will O
essentially O
create O
a O
client O

that O
can O
enforce O
a O

this O

Over O
5 O
years O
ago O
, O
we O
began O
tracking O
a O
new O
campaign O
that O
we O
called O
FakeUpdates B-Malware
( O
also O
known O
as O
SocGholish B-Malware
) O
that O
used O
compromised O
websites O
to O
trick O
users O
into O
running O
a O
fake O
browser O
update O
. O

Instead O
, O
victims O
would O
end O
up O
infecting O
their O
computers O
with O
the O
NetSupport B-System
RAT I-System
, O
allowing O
threat O
actors O
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
and O
deliver O
additional O
payloads O
. O

As O
we O
have O
seen O
over O
the O
years O
, O
SocGholish B-Malware
is O
an O
established O
player O
that O
has O
managed O
to O
compromise O
countless O
victims O
and O
deliver O
ransomware O
after O
facilitating O
the O
installation O
of O
tools O
like O
Cobalt B-System
Strike I-System
or O
Mimikatz B-System
. O

The O
new O
campaign O
, O
which O
we O
call O
FakeSG B-Malware
, O
also O
relies O
on O
hacked B-System
WordPress I-System
websites I-System
to O
display O
a O
custom O
landing O
page O
mimicking O
the O
victim O
's O
browser O
. O

The O
threat B-Organization
actors I-Organization
are O
distributing O
NetSupport B-System
RAT I-System
either O
as O
a O
zipped O
download O
or O
via O
an O
Internet O
shortcut O
. O

While O
FakeSG B-Malware
appears O
to O
be O
a O
newcomer O
, O
it O
uses O
different O
layers O
of O
obfuscation O
and O
delivery O
techniques O
that O
make O
it O
a O
threat O
to O
take O
seriously O
and O
which O
could O
potentially O
rival O
with O
SocGholish B-Malware
. O

We O
first O
heard O
of O
this O
new O
campaign O
thanks O
to O
a O
Mastodon B-Organization
post O
by O
Randy B-Organization
McEoin I-Organization
. O

The O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
are O
very O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
SocGholish B-Malware
and O
it O
would O
be O
easy O
to O
think O
the O
two O
are O
related O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
chain O
also O
leads O
to O
NetSupport B-System
RAT I-System
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
call O
this O
variant O
FakeSG B-Malware

FakeSG B-Malware
has O
different O
browser O
templates O
depending O
on O
which O
browser O
the O
victim O
is O
running O
. O

The O
themed O

look O
very O
professional O

are O
more O
up O

than O
its O

Compromised B-System
websites I-System
( O

a O

the O

We O
should O
note O
that O
SocGholish B-Malware

we O
will O
focus O
on O
the O
one O
