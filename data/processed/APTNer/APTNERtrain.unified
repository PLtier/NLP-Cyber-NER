( O
RAT O
) O
written O

We O
named O
this O
RAT O
" O
JhoneRAT B-Malware
" O
. O

The O
python O
code O
is O
wrapped O
into O
an O
executable O
using O
pyinstaller O
. O

It O
uses O
minimal O
obfuscation O
applied O
only O
on O
variables O
and O
function O
naming O
. O

The O
RAT O
starts O
by O
launching O
three O
threads O
. O

The O
first O
is O
responsible O
for O
checking O
if O
the O
system O
has O
the O
targeted O
keyboard O
layout O
— O
this O
is O
exclusively O
in O

, O
finally O
, O
the O
last O
one O
to O
be O
started O
is O
the O
main O
cycle O
for O
the O
RAT O
. O

As O
we O
explained O
before O
, O
the O
RAT O
targets O
specific O
countries O
by O
checking O
the O
keyboard O
's O
layout O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
first O
checks O
it O
performs O
when O
it O
is O
executed O
. O

The O
persistence O
is O
achieved O
by O
adding O
an O
entry O
with O
the O
name O
" O
ChromeUpdater O
" O
to O
the O
' O
Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run O
' O
. O

This O
RAT O
uses O
three O
different O
cloud O
services O
to O
perform O
all O
its O
command O
and O
control O
( O
C2 O
) O
activities O
. O

It O

) O
every O
10 O
seconds O
using O
the O
BeautifulSoup O
HTML O
parser O
to O
identify O
new O

. O

These O
commands O
can O
be O
issued O
to O
a O
specific O
victim O
based O
on O
the O
UID O
generated O
on O
each O
target O
( O
by O
using O
the O
disk O
serial O
and O
contextual O
information O
such O
as O
the O
hostname O
, O
the O
antivirus O
and O
the O
OS O
) O
or O
to O
all O
of O
them O
. O

The O
Exfiltration O
, O
however O
, O
is O
done O
via O
other O
cloud O
providers O
. O

The O
screenshots O
are O
exfiltrated O
via O
the O
ImgBB O
website O
. O

The O
remaining O
commands O
send O
feedback O
by O
posting O
data O
into O
Google O
Forms O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
RAT O
is O
able O
to O
download O
files O
encoded O
in O
base64 O
on O
Google O
Drive O
. O

Feature-wise O
, O
the O
RAT O
has O
three O
commands O
: O
a O
screenshot O
and O
upload O
it O
to O
ImgBB O
. O

Download O
binary O
disguised O
has O
a O

and O

it O
. O

Execute O
a O
command O
and O
send O
the O
output O
to O

. O

The O
attacker O
put O
a O
couple O
of O
tricks O
in O
place O
to O
avoid O
execution O
on O
virtual O
machines O
( O
sandbox O
) O
. O

The O
first O
trick O
is O
the O
check O
of O
the O
serial O
number O
of O
the O
disk O
. O

The O
actor O
used O
the O
same O
technique O
in O
the O
macro O
and O
in O
the O
JhoneRAT B-Malware
. O

By O
default O
, O
most O
of O
the O
virtual O
machines O
do O
not O
have O
a O
serial O
number O
on O
the O
disk O
. O

The O
attacker O
used O
a O
second O
trick O
to O
avoid O
analysis O
of O
the O
python O
code O
. O

The O
actor O
used O
the O
same O
trick O
that O
FireEye B-Organization
in O
the O
Flare-On O
6 O
: O
Challenge O
7: O
They O
removed O
the O
header O
of O
the O
python O
bytecode O
. O

It O
can O
be O
perfectly O
executed O
without O
the O
header O
, O
but O
tools O
such O
as O
uncompyle6 O
need O
this O
header O
: O
$ O
uncompyle6 O
final2 O
. O

ImportError O
: O
Unknown O
magic O
number O

in O

. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
generated O
code O
by O
uncompyle6 O
varies O
depending O
on O
the O
version O
and O
the O
impact O
is O
important O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
analysis O
and O
the O
behaviour O
of O
the O
executed O
malware O
, O
the O
correct O
interpretation O
is O
the O
first O
one O
based O
on O
the O
oldest O
version O
of O
uncompyle6 O
. O

For O
this O
specific O
condition O
, O
it O
is O
important O
because O
it O
's O
filtering O
on O
the O
keyboard O
layout O
to O
identify O
the O
targets O
. O

This O
campaign O
shows O
a O
threat O
actor O
interested O
in O
specific O
Middle O
Eastern O
and O
Arabic-speaking O
countries O
. O

It O
also O
shows O
us O
an O
actor O
that O
puts O
effort O
in O
opsec O
by O
only O
using O
cloud O
providers O
. O

The O
malicious O
documents O
, O
the O
droppers O
and O
the O
RAT O
itself O
are O
developed O
around O
cloud O
providers O
. O

Additionally O
the O
attackers O
implemented O
anti-VM O
( O
and O
sandbox O
) O
and O
anti-analysis O
tricks O
to O
hide O
the O
malicious O
activities O
to O
the O
analyst O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
VM O
or O
the O
sandbox O
must O
have O
the O
keyboard O
layout O
of O
the O
targeted O
countries O
and O
a O
disk O
serial O
number O
. O

This O
campaign O
started O
in O
November O
2019 O
and O
it O
is O
still O
ongoing O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
the O
API O
key O
is O
revoked O
and O
the O
Twitter O
account O
is O
suspended O
. O

However O
, O
the O
attacker O
can O
easily O
create O
new O
accounts O
and O
update O
the O
malicious O
files O
in O
order O
to O
still O
work O
. O

This O
campaign O
shows O
us O
that O
network-based O
detection O
is O
important O
but O
must O

Since O
December O
2019 O
, O
the O
Cybereason B-Organization
Nocturnus I-Organization
team O
has O
been O
investigating O
a O
campaign O
targeting O
Palestinian O
individuals O
and O
entities O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
, O
mostly O
within O
the O
Palestinian O
territories O
. O

This O
campaign O
uses O
social O
engineering O
and O
decoy O
documents O
related O
to O
geopolitical O
affairs O
and O
relations O
between O
the O
Palestinian O
government O
, O

Part O
one O
of O
this O
research O
investigates O
the O

where O
attackers O
use O

with O

During O
the O

victims O
are O
infected O
with O
a O
previously O
undocumented O
backdoor B-Malware
, O
dubbed O
Pierogi B-Malware
by O
Cybereason O
. O

This O
backdoor B-Malware
allows O
attackers O
to O
spy O
on O
targeted O
victims O
. O

Cybereason O
suspects O
that O
the O
backdoor B-Malware
may O
have O
been O
obtained O
in O
underground O
communities O
rather O
than O
home-grown O
, O
as O
the O
evidence O
found O
in O
the O
code O
of O
the O
backdoor O
suggests O
it O
may O
have O
been O
developed O
by O
Ukranian-speaking O
hackers O

In O
particular O
, O
these O

appear O
to O
be O

attacks O
carried O
out O
by O
a O

called O
MoleRATs B-Organization
( O

discovered O
recent O
, O
targeted O

in O
the O
Middle O

to O
deliver O
the O
Pierogi B-Malware
backdoor I-Malware
for O
politically-driven O

. O

Targeting O
Palestinians O
: O
The O
campaigns O
seems O
to O
target O
Palestinian O
individuals O
and O
entities O
, O
likely O
related O
to O
the O
Palestinian O
government O
. O

Using O
Geopolitically-charged O
Lure O
Content O
: O
The O
attackers O
use O
specially O
crafted O
lure O
content O
to O
trick O
their O
targets O
into O
opening O
malicious O
files O
that O
infect O
the O
victim O
’s O
machine O
with O
the O
Pierogi B-Malware
backdoor I-Malware
. O

The O
decoy O
content O
of O
the O
malicious O
files O
revolves O
around O
various O
political O
affairs O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
, O
specifically O
targeting O
the O
tension O
between O
Hamas O
and O
other O

in O
the O
region O
. O

Perpetrated O
by O
an O
Arabic-speaking O
APT O
, O
MoleRATs B-Organization
: O
The O
modus-operandi O
of O
the O
attackers O
as O
well O
as O
the O
social O
engineering O
decoy O
content O
seem O
aligned O
with O
previous O
attacks O
carried O
out O
by O
an O
Arabic-speaking O
APT O
group O
called O
MoleRATs B-Organization
( O
aka O
Gaza B-Organization
Cybergang I-Organization
) O
. O

This O
group O
has O
been O
operating O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
since O
2012 O
. O

Similar O
to O
previous O
attacks O
, O
this O
campaign O
starts O
with O
social O
engineering O
. O

In O
one O
instance O
, O
it O
lures O
victims O
to O
open O
an O
email O
attachment O
. O

In O
others O
, O
it O
persuades O
victims O
to O
download O
a O
report O
about O
a O
recent O
political O
affair O
pertaining O
to O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
specifically O
to O
Palestinian O
matters O
. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
the O
downloaded O
file O
is O
either O
an O
executable O
that O
masquerades O
as O
a O
Microsoft O
Word O
document O
or O
a O
weaponized O
Microsoft O
Word O
document O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
victim O
double-clicks O
on O
the O
dropper O
, O
they O
are O
presented O
with O
the O
decoy O
document O
. O

The O
document O
lowers O
the O
victim O
’s O
suspicions O
by O
distracting O
them O
with O
a O
real O
document O
while O
the O
dropper O
installs O
the O
backdoor B-Malware
. O

However O
, O
some O
of O
the O
documents O
also O
play O
an O
additional O
role O
in O
the O
attack O
. O

While O
some O
are O
more O
neutral O
, O
quoting O
from O
newspapers O
and O
the O
media O
, O
others O
seem O
to O
report O
fake O
news O
to O
spread O
misinformation O
that O
serves O
a O
political O

The O
records O
of O
the O

involved O
in O
this O

seem O
to O
show O
that O
the O

created O
a O
new O

specifically O
for O
this O

. O

The O

were O
registered O
in O
November O
2019 O
and O
operationalized O
shortly O
after O

In O
part O

of O
this O

we O
examined O
the O
Pierogi O

Cybereason B-Organization
suspects O
this O
targets O
Palestinian O
individuals O
and O

in O
the O
Middle O
East O
, O
specifically O
directed O
at O
in O
the O

The O
threat O

behind O
the O
campaign O
use O
social O

to O
infect O
their O

with O
the O
Pierogi B-Malware
backdoor I-Malware
for O
cyber O
espionage O
purposes O
. O

The O
threat O
actor O
behind O
the O
attack O
invested O
considerable O
time O
and O
effort O
to O
lure O
their O
victims O
with O
specially-crafted O
documents O
that O
target O
Palestinian O
individuals O

in O
the O
Middle O

. O

In O
our O
analysis O
, O
we O
reviewed O
the O
TTPs O
and O
the O
decoy O

, O
and O
pointed O
out O
the O
similarities O
between O
previous O
attacks O
that O
have O
been O
attributed O
to O
MoleRATs B-Organization
, O
an O
Arabic-speaking O
, O
politically O
motivated O
group O
that O
has O
operated O
the O
Middle O
East O
since O
2012 O
. O

The O
Pierogi B-Malware
backdoor I-Malware
discovered O
by O
Cybereason B-Organization
during O
this O
investigation O
seems O
to O
be O
undocumented O
and O
gives O
the O

capabilities O
over O

. O

Based O
on O
the O
Ukranian O
language O
embedded O
in O
the O
backdoor B-Malware
, O
Cybereason B-Organization
raises O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
backdoor B-Malware
was O
obtained O
in O
underground O

by O
the O

actors O
, O
rather O
than O

As O
we O
’ve O
observed O
with O
cybercriminal O
groups O
that O
aim O
to O
maximize O
profits O
for O
every O
campaign O
, O
silence O
does O
n’t O
necessarily O

It O
appears O
hacking O
group O
Outlaw B-Organization
, O
which O
has O
been O
silent O
for O
the O
past O
few O
months O
, O
was O
simply O
developing O
their O
toolkit O
for O
illicit O
income O
sources O
. O

While O
they O
have O
been O
quiet O
since O
our O
June O
analysis O
, O
we O
observed O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
group O
’s O
activities O
in O
December O
, O
with O
updates O
on O
the O
kits O
’ O
capabilities O
reminiscent O
of O
their O
previous O
attacks O
. O

The O
updates O
expanded O
scanner O
parameters O
and O
targets O
, O
looped O
execution O
of O
files O
via O
error O
messages O
, O
improved O
evasion O
techniques O
for O
scanning O
activities O
, O
and O
improved O
mining O
profits O
by O
killing O
off O
both O
the O
competition O
and O
their O
own O
previous O
miners O
. O

We O
analyzed O
the O
kits O
, O
which O
were O
designed O
to O
steal O
information O
from O
the O
automotive O
and O
finance O
industries O
, O
launch O
subsequent O
attacks O
on O
already O
compromised O
systems O
, O
and O
( O
possibly O
) O
sell O
stolen O
information O
. O

Comparing O
this O
development O
to O
their O
previous O
attacks O
, O
we O
think O
Outlaw B-Organization
may O
be O
aiming O
to O
go O
after O
enterprises O
that O
have O
yet O
to O
update O
their O
systems O
, O
assessing O
security O
and O
changes O
with O
their O
previously O
infected O
hosts O
, O
finding O
new O
and O
old O
targets O
, O
and O
possibly O
testing O
their O
updates O
in O
the O
wild O
. O

We O
will O
continue O
to O
observe O
the O
group O
’s O
activities O
as O
they O
target O
industries O
from O
the O
United O
States O
and O
Europe O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
samples O
we O
collected O
and O
traced O
to O
456 O
distinct O
IPs O
, O
we O
expect O
the O
group O
to O
be O
more O
active O
in O
the O
coming O
months O
as O
we O
observed O
changes O
on O
the O
versions O
we O
acquired O
. O

These O
new O
samples O
targeted O
Linux- B-System
and O
Unix-based B-System
operating I-System

, O
vulnerable O

, O
and O

of O

by O
exploiting O
known O

with O
available O

. O

This O
time O
, O
the O

explored O
unpatched O

vulnerable O
to O
CVE-2016-8655 O
and O
Dirty B-Vulnerability

( O

were O
also O
used O
to O
attack O

. O

While O
no O
phishing- O
or O
social O
engineering-initiated O
routines O
were O
observed O
in O
this O
campaign O
, O
we O
found O
multiple O
attacks O
over O
the O
network O
that O
are O
considered O
“ O
loud. O


” O
These O
involved O
large-scale O
scanning O
operations O
of O
IP O
ranges O
intentionally O
launched O
from O
the O
command O
and O
control O
( O
C&C O
) O

. O

The O
honeynet O
graphs O
, O
which O
show O
activity O
peaks O
associated O
with O
specific O
actions O
, O
also O
suggest O
that O
the O
scans O
were O
timed O
. O

We O
also O
considered O
the O
move O
as O
an O
obfuscation O
technique O
, O
as O
it O
was O
mixed O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
script O
kiddie O
activities O
that O
can O
easily O
be O
mistaken O
for O
grey O
noise O
online O
. O

The O
attackers O
could O
hide O
their O
activities O
if O
they O
noted O
the O
business O
hours O
of O
the O
intended O
targets O
and O
performed O
the O
actions O
coinciding O
with O
said O
times O
. O

From O
the O
sample O
we O
analyzed O
, O
attacks O
started O
from O
one O
virtual O
private O
server O
( O

) O
that O
searches O
for O
a O

. O

Once O
infected O
, O
the O
C&C O
commands O
for O
the O
infected O
system O
launches O
a O
loud O
scanning O
activity O
and O
spreads O
the O
botnet O
by O
sending O
a O
“ O

” O
of O

at O
once O
with O
naming O

” O
They O
attempted O
to O
evade O

inspection O
by O
encoding O
the O

. O

The O

but O
updated O
with O
a O
larger O
set O
of O

and O
programmed O
to O
run O
in O
the O

. O

The O
kit O
we O
found O
is O
in O
tgz O

, O
though O
we O
have O
observed O
some O

disguised O

While O
previous O

took O
advantage O
of O
competing O

creates O
a O

The O

then O
runs O
in O

Another O
variant O
executes O
a O
set O
of O
commands O
once O
a O

Most O
of O
these O

are O

In O
a O

, O
we O
observed O
that O

it O

indicating O
that O
this O

removes O
the O
remaining O

If O
the O

has O
been O
previously O

with O
a O

, O
it O
also O
attempts O

Based O
on O

Both O

We O
also O
found O
the O

the O

cleans O
out O
all O

The O
Shellbot B-Malware
disguises O
itself O
as O
a O

commonly O
the O

seen O
on O
many O
Unix- B-System

Linux-based B-System

This O
allows O
the O
malicious O

The O

It O
remains O

whether O
these O
are O
leftover O
code O
from O
the O
previous O

or O
their O
particular O
purposes O
were O
served O
. O

Shellbot B-Malware

with O
a O

Since O
discovering O
the O
operations O
of O
this O
group O
in O
2018 O
, O
Outlaw B-Organization
continues O
to O
use O
scripts O
, O
codes O
, O
and O
commands O
that O
have O
been O
previously O
used O
and O
deployed O
. O

These O
routines O
are O
indicative O
of O
the O
group O
’s O
aim O
to O
get O
quantitative O
returns O
through O
varied O
cybercriminal O
profit O
streams O
. O

This O
was O
also O
reinforced O
by O
their O
naming O
conventions O
, O
wherein O
different O
versions O
are O
simply O
named O
after O
the O
code O
iterations O
, O
following O
a O
specific O
format O
regardless O
of O

Furthermore O
, O
based O
on O
the O
group O

use O
of O
dated O
exploits O
as O
vectors O
that O
companies O
would O
have O
likely O
addressed O
with O

and O
regular O

, O
it O
appears O
that O
they O
’re O
going O
after O
enterprises O
who O
have O
yet O
to O
patch O
their O
systems O
, O
as O
well O
as O
companies O
with O
internet-facing O
systems O
with O
weak O
to O
no O
monitoring O
of O

Considering O
the O
amount O
of O
resources O
needed O
to O
deploy O
all O
the O
necessary O
patches O
for O
an O
enterprise O
( O
such O
as O
quality O
testing O
and O
operations O
alignment O
) O
, O
which O
implies O
costly O
downtime O
for O
operations O
and O
the O
hesitation O
to O
update O
all O
systems O
immediately O
, O
Outlaw B-Organization
may O
find O
even O
more O
targets O

victims O
for O
their O
updated O
botnets O
every O
time O
there O
is O
a O

be O
downloaded O
. O

Save O
for O
a O
few O
iteration O
updates O
, O
combinations O
from O
previous O
deployments O
, O
and O
using O
the O
routines O
repetitively O
for O
every O
campaign O
, O
we O
found O
very O
little O
changes O
in O
the O
group O
’s O
toolkit O
, O
which O
allowed O
various O
honeypots B-Malware
across O
the O
Eastern O
European O
region O
to O
detect O
many O
of O
the O
sent O
binaries O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
group O
uses O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
IP O
addresses O
as O
input O
for O
scanning O
activities O
that O
are O
grouped O
by O
country O
, O
allowing O
them O
to O
attack O
certain O
regions O
or O
areas O
within O
particular O
periods O
of O
the O
year O
, O
as O
previously O
observed O
. O

We O
think O
the O
group O
has O
likely O
become O
more O
enterprising O
, O
and O
learned O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
some O
details O
from O
their O
previous O
campaigns O
to O
maximize O
profit O
opportunities O
while O
exerting O
minimal O
effort O
. O

By O
shaping O
the O
attack O
, O
the O
group O
may O
be O
able O
to O
create O
niches O
in O
the O
underground O
, O
catering O
to O
the O
specific O
needs O
of O
their O
customers O
. O

Also O
aware O
of O
the O
existing O
laws O
in O
Europe O
, O
they O
can O
avoid O
prosecution O
in O
certain O
countries O
as O
long O
as O
they O
avoid O
attacking O
them O
. O

Collection O
of O
results O
and O
data O
from O
scanning O
in O
this O
manner O
might O
be O
easier O
to O
sort O
( O
while O
allowing O
them O
to O
stay O
under O
the O
radar O
) O
, O
as O
compared O
to O
getting O
feedback O
from O
zombie O

deployed O
around O
the O

simultaneously O
. O

We O
will O
continue O
to O

this O

Winnti B-Organization
Group I-Organization
targeting O
universities O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
. O

In O
November O
2019 O
, O
we O
discovered O
a O
new O
campaign O
run O
by O
the O
Winnti B-Organization
Group I-Organization
against O
two O
Hong O
Kong O
universities O
. O

We O
found O
a O
new O
variant O
of O
the O
ShadowPad B-Malware
backdoor I-Malware
, O
the O
group O
’s O
flagship O
backdoor B-Malware
, O
deployed O
using O
a O
new O
launcher O
and O
embedding O
numerous O
modules O
. O

The B-Malware
Winnti I-Malware
malware I-Malware
was O
also O
found O
at O
these O
universities O
a O
few O
weeks O
prior O
to O
ShadowPad B-Malware
. O

The O
Winnti B-Organization
Group I-Organization
, O
active O
since O
at O
least O
2012 O
, O
is O
responsible O
for O
for O
high-profile O
supply-chain O
attacks O
against O
the O
video O
game O
and O
software O
industries O
leading O
to O
the O
distribution O
of O
trojanized B-Malware
software I-Malware
( O
such O
as O
CCleaner O
, O
ASUS O
LiveUpdate O
and O
multiple O
video O
games O
) O
that O
is O
then O
used O
to O
compromise O
more O
victims O
. O

It O
is O
also O
known O
for O
having O
compromised O
various O
targets O
in O
the O
healthcare O
and O
education O
sectors O
. O

ESET O
researchers O
recently O
published O
a O
white O
paper O
updating O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
arsenal O
of O
the O
Winnti B-Organization
Group I-Organization
, O
following O
a O
blog O
post O
documenting O
a O
supply-chain O
attack O
targeting O
the O
videogame O
industry O
in O
Asia O
. O

Additionally O
, O
we O
published O
a O
blog O
post O
on O
a O
new O
backdoor B-Malware
named O
skip-2.0 B-Malware
that O
targets O
Microsoft O
SQL O
Server O
. O

This O
article O
focuses O
on O
the O
technical O
details O
of O
this O
new O
ShadowPad B-Malware
variant O
. O

About O
the O
“ O
Winnti B-Organization
Group I-Organization
” O
naming O
: O
have O
chosen O
to O
keep O
the O
name O
“ O
Winnti B-Organization
Group I-Organization
” O
since O
it O
’s O
the O
name O
first O
used O
to O
identify O
it O
, O
in O
2013 O
, O
by O
Kaspersky B-Organization
. O

Since O
Winnti B-Malware
is O
also O
a O
malware O
family O
, O
we O
always O
write O
“ O
Winnti B-Organization
Group I-Organization
” O
when O
we O
refer O
to O
the O
malefactors O
behind O
the O
attacks O
. O

Since O
2013 O
, O
it O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
Winnti B-Malware
is O
only O
one O
of O
the O
many O
malware O
families O
used O
by O
the O
Winnti B-Organization
Group I-Organization
. O

In O
November O
2019 O
, O
ESET O
’s O
machine-learning O
engine O
, O
Augur O
, O
detected O
a O
malicious O
and O
unique O
sample O
present O
on O
multiple O
computers O
belonging O
to O
two O
Hong O
Kong O
universities O
where O
the O
Winnti B-Malware
malware O
had O
already O
been O
found O
at O
the O
end O
of O
October O
. O

The O
suspicious O
sample O
detected O
by O
Augur O
is O
actually O
a O
new O
32-bit O
ShadowPad B-Malware
launcher O
. O

Samples O
from O
both O
ShadowPad B-Malware
and O
Winnti B-Malware
found O
at O
these O
universities O
contain O
campaign O
identifiers O
and O
C&C O
URLs O
with O
the O
names O
of O
the O
universities O
, O
which O
indicates O
a O
targeted O
attack O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
two O
compromised O
universities O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
C&C O
URL O
format O
used O
by O
the O
attackers O
we O
have O
reasons O
to O
think O
that O
at O
least O
three O
additional O
Hong O
Kong O
universities O
may O
have O
been O
compromised O
using O
these O
same O
ShadowPad B-Malware
and O
Winnti B-Malware
variants O
. O

This O
campaign O
of O
the O
Winnti B-Organization
Group I-Organization
against O
Hong O
Kong O
universities O
was O
taking O
place O
in O
the O
context O
of O
Hong O
Kong O
facing O
civic O
protests O
that O
started O
in O
June O
2019 O
triggered O
by O
an O
extradition O
bill O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
bill O
was O
withdrawn O
in O
October O
2019 O
, O
protests O
continued O
, O
demanding O
full O
democracy O
and O
investigation O
of O
the O
Hong O
Kong O
police O
. O

These O
protests O
gathered O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
people O
in O
the O
streets O
with O
large O
support O
from O
students O
of O
Hong O
Kong O
universities O
, O
leading O
to O
multiple O
university O
campus O
occupations O
by O
the O
protesters O
. O

We O
have O
contacted O
the O
compromised O
universities O
and O
provided O
the O
necessary O
information O
and O
assistance O
to O
remediate O
the O
compromise O
. O

Unlike O
previous O
ShadowPad B-Malware
variants O
documented O
in O
our O
white O
paper O
on O
the O
arsenal O
of O
the O
Winnti B-Organization
Group I-Organization
, O
this O
launcher O
is O
not O
obfuscated O
using O
VMProtect O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
encrypted O
payload O
is O
neither O
embedded O
in O
the O
overlay O
nor O
located O
in O
a O
COM1:NULL.dat O
alternate O
data O
stream O
. O

And O
the O
usual O
RC5 O
encryption O
with O
a O
key O
derived O
from O
the O
volume O
ID O
of O
the O
system O
drive O
of O
the O
victim O
machine O
( O
as O
seen O
in O
the O
PortReuse B-Malware
backdoor I-Malware
, O
skip-2.0 B-Malware
and O
some O
ShadowPad B-Malware
variants O
) O
is O
not O
present O
either O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
launcher O
is O
much O
simpler O
. O

The O
launcher O
is O
a O
32-bit O
DLL O
named O
hpqhvsei.dll O
, O
which O
is O
the O
name O
of O
a O
legitimate O
DLL O
loaded O
by O
hpqhvind.exe O
. O

This O
executable O
is O
from O
HP O
and O
is O
usually O
installed O
with O
their O
printing O
and O
scanning O
software O
called O
“ O
HP O
Digital O
Imaging O
” O
. O

In O
this O
case O
the O
legitimate O
hpqhvind.exe O
was O
dropped O
by O
the O
attackers O
, O
along O
with O
their O
malicious O
hpqhvsei.dll O
, O
in O
C:\Windows\Temp O
. O

Although O
we O
do O
not O
have O
the O
component O
that O
dropped O
and O
executed O
this O
launcher O
, O
the O
presence O
of O
these O
files O
leads O
us O
to O
think O
that O
the O
initial O
execution O
of O
this O
launcher O
is O
done O
through O
DLL O
side-l O
. O

When O
the O
malicious O
DLL O
is O
loaded O
at O
hpqhvind.exe O
startup O
, O
its O
DLLMain O
function O
is O
called O
that O
will O
check O
its O
parent O
process O
for O
the O
following O
sequence O
of O
bytes O
at O
offset O
0x10BA O
. O

In O
the O
case O
where O
the O
parent O
process O
is O
hpqhvind.exe O
, O
this O
sequence O
of O
bytes O
is O
present O
at O
this O
exact O
location O
and O
the O
malicious O
DLL O
will O
proceed O
to O
patch O
the O
parent O
process O
in O
memory O
. O

It O
replaces O
the O
original O
instructions O
at O
0x10BA O
with O
an O
unconditional O
jump O
( O
jmp O
– O
0xE9 O
) O
to O
the O
address O
of O
the O
function O
from O
hpqhvsei.dll O
that O
decrypts O
and O
executes O
the O
encrypted O
payload O
embedded O
in O
the O
launcher O
. O

The O
decompiled O
function O
responsible O
for O
patching O
the O
parent O
process O
. O

In O
case O
hpqhvsei.dll O
is O
loaded O
by O
a O
different O
process O
than O
hpqhvind.exe O
, O
the O
malicious O
code O
will O
not O
be O
decrypted O
and O
executed O
. O

The O
difference O
between O
the O
original O
and O
patched O
hpqhvind.exe O
. O

The O
part O
of O
the O
code O
that O
is O
patched O
is O
located O
at O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
the O
main O
function O
of O
hpqhvind.exe O
. O

The O
patched O
code O
is O
located O
right O
after O
the O
load O
of O
hpqhvsei.dll O
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
function O
responsible O
for O
decrypting O
and O
executing O
the O
payload O
is O
executed O
directly O
after O
the O
load O
of O
the O
malicious O
DLL O
. O

The O
encrypted O
payload O
is O
located O
in O
the O
.rdata O
section O
of O
hpqhvsei.dll O
and O
the O
decryption O
algorithm O
is O
an O
XOR O
loop O
where O
the O
XOR O
key O
is O
updated O
at O
each O
iteration O
. O

The O
decrypted O
payload O
is O
the O
usual O
shellcode O
responsible O
for O
ShadowPad B-Malware
initialization O
( O
obfuscated O
using O
fake O
conditional O
jumps O
to O
hinder O
disassembly O
) O
. O

After O
having O
been O
decrypted O
, O
ShadowPad B-Malware
’s O
shellcode O
is O
executed O
. O

It O
will O
first O
achieve O
persistence O
on O
the O
system O
by O
writing O
the O
in-memory O
patched O
parent O
process O
to O
disk O
to O
a O
path O
specified O
in O
the O
configuration O
string O
pool O
. O

In O
the O
case O
we O
examined O
, O
the O
path O
was O
C:\ProgramData\DRM\CLR\CLR.exe O
. O

It O
then O
creates O
a O
service O
named O
clr_optimization_v4.0.30229_32 O
, O
which O
is O
responsible O
for O
executing O
CLR.exe O
. O

To O
avoid O
suspicion O
, O
this O
service O
name O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
executable O
name O
, O
were O
chosen O
to O
look O
similar O
to O
the O
name O
of O
a O
Microsoft O

Service O
. O

The O
numbering O
on O
each O
arrow O
corresponds O
to O
the O
chronological O
sequence O
of O

this O

much O
higher O
( O

) O
than O
the O
number O
of O

embedded O
in O
the O
variants O
previously O
documented O
in O
our O
white O
paper O
( O
8 O
to O
10 O
modules O
) O
. O

By O
default O
, O
every O
keystroke O
is O
recorded O
using O
the O
Keylogger O
module O
( O
306, O
previously O
documented O
by O
Avast B-Organization
) O
and O
saved O
to O

in O
the O

%APPDATA%\PAGM\OEY\XWWEYG\WAOUE O
. O

The O
log O
file O
is O
encrypted O
using O
the O
same O
algorithm O
as O
the O
one O
used O
to O
encrypt O
static O
strings O
from O
the O
module O
. O

Using O
this O
module O
by O
default O
indicates O
that O
the O
attackers O
are O
interested O
in O
stealing O
information O
from O
the O
victims O
’ O
machines O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
variants O
we O
described O
in O
our O
white O
paper O
did O
n’t O
even O
have O
that O
module O
embedded O
. O

As O
with O
previous O
ShadowPad B-Malware
variants O
, O
the O
Config O
module O
( O
102 O
) O
contains O
an O
encrypted O
string O
pool O
that O
can O
be O
accessed O
from O
any O
other O
module O
. O

The O
string O
pool O
is O
never O
stored O
entirely O
decrypted O
in O
memory O
; O
the O
field O
of O
interest O
is O
decrypted O
when O
needed O
and O
then O
immediately O
freed O
( O
thus O
quickly O
unavailable O
) O
. O

The O
configuration O
size O
is O
2180 O
bytes O
and O
the O
encrypted O
strings O
are O
located O
at O
offset O
0x84 O
. O

The O
algorithm O
used O
to O
decrypt O
the O
strings O
is O
the O
same O
as O
the O
one O
used O
to O
decrypt O
the O
static O
strings O
of O
the O
module O
. O

The O
campaign O
ID O
is O
located O
at O
offset O
0x99 O
and O
is O
the O
name O
of O
the O
targeted O
university O
. O

Having O
a O
campaign O
ID O
related O
to O
the O
target O
is O
quite O
common O
in O
the O
case O
of O
ShadowPad B-Malware
and O
Winnti B-Malware
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
timestamp O
present O
in O
this O
config O
at O
offset O
0x84 O
is O
later O
than O
the O
modules O
’ O
timestamps O
and O
the O
loader O
compilation O
timestamp O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
this O
config O
is O
added O
manually O
to O
the O
sample O
after O
having O
been O
built O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
’s O
probably O
coincidental O
, O
the O
date O
within O
the O
config O
corresponds O
to O
the O
date O
of O
the O
first O
detection O
of O
this O
sample O
at O
the O
corresponding O
university O
. O

Once O
installed O
on O
the O
system O
, O
ShadowPad B-Malware
starts O
a O
hidden O
and O
suspended O
Microsoft O
Windows O
Media O
Player O
wmplayer.exe O
process O
and O
injects O
itself O
into O
that O
process O
. O

The O
path O
to O
wmplayer.exe O
is O
provided O
by O
the O
Config O
module O
. O

Once O
ShadowPad B-Malware
is O
injected O
into O
wmplayer.exe O
, O
the O
Online O
module O
will O
contact O
the O
C&C O
server O
using O
the O
URL O
specified O
in O
the O
configuration O
. O

The O
communication O
is O
then O
handled O
by O
the O
TCP O
module O
( O
200 O
) O
, O
which O
was O
previously O
documented O
by O
Kaspersky B-Organization
. O

In O
addition O
to O
ShadowPad B-Malware
, O
the O
Winnti B-Malware
malware O
was O
found O
on O
some O
machines O
at O
these O
two O
universities O
at O
the O
end O
of O
October O
( O
i.e O
. O


two O
weeks O
before O
ShadowPad B-Malware
) O
in O
the O
file O
C:\Windows\System32\oci.dll O
and O
is O
detected O
by O
ESET O
products O
as O
Win64/Winnti.CA O
. O

The O
Winnti B-Malware
malware O
usually O
contains O
a O
configuration O
specifying O
a O
campaign O
ID O
and O
a O
C&C O
URL O
. O

On O
all O
machines O
the O
campaign O
ID O
matches O
the O
name O
of O
the O
targeted O
university O
and O
the O
C&C O
URLs O
are O
: O
: O
443 O
. O


w[redacted].dnslookup.services O

. O


where O
the O
redacted O
part O
corresponds O
to O
the O
name O
of O
the O
targeted O
university O
. O

One O
can O
observe O
that O
the O
C&C O
URL O
used O
by O
both O
Winnti B-Malware
and O
ShadowPad B-Malware
complies O
to O
the O
scheme O
[backdoor_type][target_name].domain.tld O
: O
443 O
where O
[backdoor_type] O
is O
a O
single O

which O
is O
either O
“ O

” O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
Winnti B-Malware

or O
“ O
b O
” O
in O
the O
case O
of O
ShadowPad B-Malware

From O
this O

to O
find O
several O
C&C O

what O

in O
the O
2000s O
, O
relatively O
close O

Insights O
from O
one O
year O
of O
tracking O
a O
polymorphic O
threat O
. O

A O
little O
over O
a O
year O
ago O
, O
in O
October O
2018 O
, O
our O
polymorphic O
outbreak O
monitoring O
system O
detected O
a O
large O
surge O
in O
reports O
, O
indicating O
that O
a O
large-scale O
campaign O
was O
unfolding O
. O

We O
observed O
as O
the O
new O
threat O
attempted O
to O
deploy O
files O
that O
changed O
every O
20-30 O
minutes O
on O
thousands O
of O
devices O
. O

We O
gave O
the O
threat O
the O
name O
“ O
Dexphot B-Malware
, O
” O
based O
on O
certain O
characteristics O
of O
the O
malware O
code O
. O

The O
Dexphot B-Malware
attack O
used O
a O
variety O
of O
sophisticated O
methods O
to O
evade O
security O
solutions O
. O

Layers O
of O
obfuscation O
, O
encryption O
, O
and O
the O
use O
of O
randomized O
file O
names O
hid O
the O
installation O
process O
. O

Dexphot B-Malware
then O
used O
fileless O
techniques O
to O
run O
malicious O
code O
directly O
in O
memory O
, O
leaving O
only O
a O
few O
traces O
that O
can O
be O
used O
for O
forensics O
. O

It O
hijacked O
legitimate O
system O
processes O
to O
disguise O
malicious O
activity O
. O

If O
not O
stopped O
, O
Dexphot B-Malware
ultimately O
ran O
a O
cryptocurrency O
miner O
on O
the O
device O
, O
with O
monitoring O
services O
and O
scheduled O
tasks O
triggering O
re-infection O
when O
defenders O
attempt O
to O
remove O
the O
malware O
. O

In O
the O
months O
that O
followed O
, O
we O
closely O
tracked O
the O
threat O
and O
witnessed O
the O
attackers O
upgrade O
the O
malware O
, O
target O
new O
processes O
, O
and O
work O
around O
defensive O
measures O
. O

While O
Microsoft O
Defender O
Advanced O
Threat O
Protection O
’s O
pre-execution O
detection O
engines O
blocked O
Dexphot B-Malware
in O
most O
cases O
, O
behavior-based O
machine O
learning O
models O
provided O
protection O
for O
cases O
where O
the O
threat O
slipped O
through O
. O

Given O
the O
threat O
’s O
persistence O
mechanisms O
, O
polymorphism O
, O
and O
use O
of O
fileless O
techniques O
, O
behavior-based O
detection O
was O
a O
critical O
component O
of O
the O
comprehensive O
protection O
against O
this O
malware O
and O
other O
threats O
that O
exhibit O
similar O
malicious O
behaviors O
. O

Microsoft O

data O
shows O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
behavioral O
blocking O
and O

capabilities O
in O
stopping O
the O
Dexphot B-Malware
campaign O
. O

Over O
time O
, O
Dexphot-related O
malicious O
behavior O
reports O
dropped O
to O
a O
low O
hum O
, O
as O
the O
threat O
lost O
steam O
. O

Our O
close O
monitoring O
of O
Dexphot B-Malware
helped O
us O
ensure O
that O
our O
customers O
were O
protected O
from O
the O
evolving O
threat O
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
one O
year O
’s O
worth O
of O
intelligence O
helped O
us O
gain O
insight O
not O
only O
into O
the O
goals O
and O
motivations O
of O
Dexphot B-Malware
’s O
authors O
, O
but O
of O
cybercriminals O
in O
general O
. O

The O
early O
stages O
of O
a O
Dexphot B-Malware
infection O
involves O
numerous O
files O
and O
processes O
. O

During O
the O
execution O
stage O
, O
Dexphot O
writes O
five O
key O
files O
to O
disk O
: O
、An O
installer O
with O
two O
URLs O
; O
、An O
MSI O
package O
file O
downloaded O
from O
one O
of O
the O
URLs O
; O
、A O
password-protected O
ZIP O
archive O
; O
、A O
loader O
DLL O
, O
which O
is O
extracted O
from O
the O
archive O
; O
、An O
encrypted O
data O
file O
that O
holds O
three O
additional O
executables O
that O
are O
loaded O
into O
system O
processes O
via O
process O
hollowing O
. O

Except O
for O
the O
installer O
, O
the O
other O
processes O
that O
run O
during O
execution O
are O
legitimate O
system O
processes O
. O

This O
can O
make O
detection O
and O
remediation O
more O
difficult O
. O

These O
legitimate O
system O
processes O
include O
msiexec.exe O
( O
for O
installing O
MSI O
packages O
) O
, O
unzIP O
. O

exe O
( O
for O
extracting O

, O
schtasks.exe O
( O
for O

) O
, O
powershell.exe O
( O
for O

. O

In O
later O
stages O
, O
Dexphot B-Malware
targets O
a O
few O
other O
system O
processes O
for O
process O
hollowing O
: O
svchost.exe O

Based O
on O
Microsoft O
Defender O
ATP O
signals O
, O
SoftwareBundler B-Malware
: I-Malware
Win32/ICLoader I-Malware
and O
its O
variants O
are O
primarily O
used O
to O
drop O
and O
run O
the O
Dexphot O
installer I-Malware
. O

The O
installer O
uses O
two O
URLs O
to O
download O
malicious O
payloads O
. O

These O
are O
the O
same O
two O
URLs O
that O
Dexphot B-Malware
use O
later O
to O
establish O
persistence O
, O
update O
the O
malware O
, O
and O
re-infect O
the O
device O
. O

The O
installer O
downloads O
an O
MSI O
package O
from O
one O
of O
the O
two O
URLs O
, O
and O
then O
launches O
msiexec.exe O
to O
perform O
a O
silent O
install O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
of O
several O
instances O
of O
Dexphot B-Malware
employing O
living-off-the-land O
techniques O
, O
the O
use O
of O
legitimate O
system O
processes O
for O
nefarious O
purposes O
. O

Dexphot B-Malware
’s O
package O
often O
contains O
an O
obfuscated O
batch O
script O
. O

If O
the O
package O
contains O
this O
file O
, O
the O
script O
is O
the O
first O
thing O
that O
msiexec.exe O
runs O
when O
it O
begins O
the O
installation O
process O
. O

The O
said O
obfuscated O
script O
is O
designed O
to O
check O
for O
antivirus O
products O
. O

Dexphot B-Malware
halts O
the O
infection O
process O
immediately O
if O
an O
antivirus O
product O
is O
found O
running O
. O

When O
we O
first O
began O
our O
research O
, O
the O
batch O
script O
only O
checked O
for O
antivirus O
products O
from O
Avast O
and O
AVG O
. O

Later O
, O
Windows O
Defender O
Antivirus O
was O
added O
to O
the O
checklist O
. O

If O
the O
process O
is O
not O
halted O
, O
Dexphot B-Malware
decompresses O
the O
password-protected O
ZIP O
archive O
from O
the O
MSI O
package O
. O

The O
password O
to O
this O
archive O
is O
within O
the O
MSI O
package O
. O

Along O
with O
the O
password O
, O
the O
malware O
’s O
authors O
also O
include O
a O
clean O
version O
of O
unzIP O
. O

exe O
so O
that O
they O
do O
n’t O
have O
to O
rely O
on O
the O
target O
system O
having O
a O
ZIP O
utility O
. O

The O
unzIP O
. O

exe O
file O
in O
the O
package O
is O
usually O
named O
various O
things O
, O
such O
as O
z.exe O
or O
ex.exe O
, O
to O
avoid O
scrutiny O
. O

The O
ZIP O
archive O
usually O
contains O
three O
files O
: O
the O
loader O
DLL O
, O
an O
encrypted O
data O
file O
( O
usually O
named O
bin.dat O
) O
, O
and O
, O
often O
, O
one O
clean O
unrelated O
DLL O
, O
which O
is O
likely O
included O
to O
mislead O
detection O
. O

Dexphot B-Malware
usually O
extracts O
the O
decompressed O
files O
to O
the O
target O
system O
’s O
Favorites O
folder O
. O

The O
files O
are O
given O
new O
, O
random O
names O
, O
which O
are O
generated O
by O
concatenating O
words O
and O
numbers O
based O
on O
the O
time O
of O
execution O
( O
for O
example O
, O
C:\Users\<user>\Favorites\\Res.Center.ponse\<numbers> O
) O
. O

Msiexec.exe O
next O
calls O
rundll32.exe O
, O
specifying O
loader O
DLL O
( O
urlmon.7z O
in O
the O
example O
above O
) O
in O
order O
to O
decrypt B-Malware
the I-Malware
data I-Malware
file I-Malware
. O

The O
decryption O
process O
involves O
ADD O
and O
XOR O
operations O
, O
using O
a O
key O
hardcoded O
in O
the O
binary O
. O

The O
decrypted O
data O
contains O
three O
executables O
. O

Unlike O
the O
files O
described O
earlier O
, O
these O
executables O
are O
never O
written O
to O
the O
filesystem O
. O

Instead O
, O
they O
exist O
only O
in O
memory O
, O
and O
Dexphot B-Malware
runs O
them O
by O
loading O
them O
into O
other O
system O
processes O
via O
process O
hollowing O
. O

Process O
hollowing O
is O
a O
technique O
that O
can O
hide O
malware O
within O
a O
legitimate O
system O
process O
. O

It O
replaces O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
legitimate O
process O
with O
malicious O
code O
. O

Detecting O
malicious O
code O
hidden O
using O
this O
method O
is O
not O
trivial O
, O
so O
process O
hollowing O
has O
become O
a O
prevalent O
technique O
used O
by O
malware O
today O
. O

This O
method O
has O
the O
additional O
benefit O
of O
being O
fileless O
: O
the O
code O
can O
be O
run O
without O
actually O
being O
saved O
on O
the O
file O
system O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
harder O
to O
detect O
the O
malicious O
code O
while O
it O
’s O
running O
, O
it O
’s O
harder O
to O
find O
useful O
forensics O
after O
the O
process O
has O
stopped O
. O

To O
initiate O
process O
hollowing O
, O
the O
loader O
DLL O
targets O
two O
legitimate O
system O
processes O
, O
for O
example O
svchost.exe O
or O
nslookup.exe O
, O
and O
spawns O
them O
in O
a O
suspended O
state O
. O

The O
loader O
DLL O
replaces O
the O
contents O
of O
these O
processes O
with O
the O
first O
and O
second O
decrypted O
executables O
. O

These O
executables O
are O
monitoring O
services O
for O
maintaining O
Dexphot B-Malware
’s O
components O
. O

The O
now-malicious O
processes O
are O
released O
from O
suspension O
and O
run O
. O

Next O
, O
the O
loader O
DLL O
targets O
the O
setup.exe O
file O
in O
SysWoW64 B-System
. O

It O
removes O
setup.exe O
’s O
contents O
and O
replaces O
them O
with O
the O
third O
decrypted O
executable O
, O
a O
cryptocurrency O
miner O
. O

Although O
Dexphot B-Malware
always O
uses O
a O
cryptocurrency O
miner O
of O
some O
kind O
, O
it O
’s O
not O
always O
the O
same O
miner O
. O

It O
used O
different O
programs O
like O
XMRig B-Malware
and O
JCE B-Malware
Miner I-Malware
over O
the O
course O
of O
our O
research O
. O

The O
two O
monitoring O
services O
simultaneously O
check O
the O
status O
of O
all O
three O
malicious O
processes O
. O

Having O
dual O
monitoring O
services O
provides O
redundancy O
in O
case O
one O
of O
the O
monitoring O
processes O
is O
halted O
. O

If O
any O
of O
the O
processes O
are O
terminated O
, O
the O
monitors O
immediately O
identify O
the O
situation O
, O
terminate O
all O
remaining O
malicious O
processes O
, O
and O
re-infect O
the O
device O
. O

The O
monitoring O
components O
also O
detect O
freshly O
launched O
cmd.exe O
processes O
and O
terminate O
them O
promptly O
. O

As O
a O
final O
fail-safe O
, O
Dexphot O
uses O
schtasks.exe O
to O
create O
scheduled O
tasks O
. O

This O
persistence O
technique O
is O
interesting O
, O
because O
it O
employs O
two O
distinct O
MITRE O
ATT&CK O
techniques O
: O
Scheduled O
Task O
and O
Signed O
Binary O
Proxy O
Execution O
. O

The O
scheduled O
tasks O
call O
msiexec.exe O
as O
a O
proxy O
to O
run O
the O
malicious O
code O
, O
much O
like O
how O
msiexec.exe O
was O
used O
during O
installation O
. O

Using O
msiexec.exe O
, O
a O
legitimate O
system O
process O
, O
can O
make O
it O
harder O
to O
trace O
the O
source O
of O
malicious O
activity O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
tasks O
allow O
Dexphot B-Malware
to O
conveniently O
update O
the O
payload O
from O
the O
web O
every O
time O
the O
tasks O
run O
. O

They O
automatically O
update O
all O
of O
Dexphot B-Malware
’s O
components O
, O
both O
upon O
system O
reboot O
as O
well O
as O
every O
90 O
or O
110 O
minutes O
while O
the O
system O
is O
running O
. O

Dexphot B-Malware
also O
generates O
the O
names O
for O
the O
tasks O
at O
runtime O
, O
which O
means O
a O
simple O
block O
list O
of O
hardcoded O
task O
names O
will O
not O
be O
effective O
in O
preventing O
them O
from O
running O
. O

The O
names O
are O
usually O
in O
a O
GUID O
format O
, O
although O
after O
we O
released O
our O
first O
round O
of O
Dexphot-blocking O
protections O
, O
the O
threat O
authors O
began O
to O
use O
random O
strings O
. O

The O
threat O
authors O
have O
one O
more O
evasion O
technique O
for O
these O
scheduled O
tasks O
: O
some O
Dexphot B-Malware
variants O
copy O
msiexec.exe O
to O
an O
arbitrary O
location O
and O
give O
it O
a O
random O
name O
, O
such O
as O
%AppData%\<random>.exe O
. O

This O
makes O
the O
system O
process O
running O
malicious O
code O
a O
literal O
moving O
target O
. O

Dexphot B-Malware
exhibits O
multiple O
layers O
of O
polymorphism O
across O
the O
binaries O
it O
distributes O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
MSI O
package O
used O
in O
the O
campaign O
contains O
different O
files O
, O
as O
shown O
in O
the O
table O
below O
. O

The O
MSI O
packages O
generally O
include O
a O
clean O
version O
of O
unzIP O
. O

exe O
, O
a O
password-protected O
ZIP O
file O
, O
and O
a O
batch O
file O
that O
checks O
for O
currently O
installed O
antivirus O
products O
. O

However O
, O
the O
batch O
file O
is O
not O
always O
present O
, O
and O
the O
names O
of O
the O
ZIP O
files O
and O
Loader O
DLLs O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
password O
for O
extracting O
the O
ZIP O
file O
, O
all O
change O
from O
one O
package O
to O
the O
next O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
contents O
of O
each O
Loader O
DLL O
differs O
from O
package O
to O
package O
, O
as O
does O
the O
encrypted O
data O
included O
in O
the O
ZIP O
file O
. O

This O
leads O
to O
the O
generation O
of O
a O
different O
ZIP O
archive O
and O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
a O
unique O
MSI O
package O
, O
each O
time O
the O
attacker O
bundles O
the O
files O
together O
. O

Because O
of O
these O
carefully O
designed O
layers O
of O
polymorphism O
, O
a O
traditional O
file-based O
detection O
approach O
wouldn’t O
be O
effective O
against O
Dexphot B-Malware
. O

Besides O
tracking O
the O
files O
and O
processes O
that O
Dexphot B-Malware
uses O
to O
execute O
an O
attack O
, O
we O
have O
also O
been O
monitoring O
the O
domains O
used O
to O
host O
malicious O
payloads O
. O

The O
URLs O
used O
for O
hosting O
all O
follow O
a O
similar O
pattern O
. O

The O
domain O
address O
usually O
ends O
in O
a O
.info O
or O
.net O
TLD O
, O
while O
the O
file O
name O
for O
the O
actual O
payload O
consists O
of O
random O
characters O
, O
similar O
to O
the O
randomness O
previously O
seen O
being O
used O
to O
generate O
file O
names O
and O
scheduled O
tasks O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
URLs O
listed O
were O
in O
use O
for O
an O
extended O
period O
. O

However O
, O
the O
MSI O
packages O
hosted O
at O
each O
URL O
are O
frequently O
changed O
or O
updated O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
every O
few O
days O
more O
domains O
are O
generated O
to O
host O
more O
payloads O
. O

After O
a O
few O
months O
of O
monitoring O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
identify O
around O
200 O
unique O
Dexphot B-Malware
domains O
. O

Dexphot B-Malware
is O
not O
the O
type O
of O
attack O
that O
generates O
mainstream O
media O
attention O
; O
it O
’s O
one O
of O
the O
countless O
malware O
campaigns O
that O
are O
active O
at O
any O
given O
time O
. O

Its O
goal O
is O

RevengeHotels B-Organization
is O
a O
targeted O
cybercrime O
malware O
campaign O
against O
hotels O
, O
hostels O
, O
hospitality O
and O
tourism O
companies O
, O
mainly O
, O
but O
not O
exclusively O
, O
located O
in O
Brazil O
. O

We O
have O
confirmed O
more O
than O
20 O
hotels O
that O
are O
victims O
of O
the O
group O
, O
located O
in O
eight O
states O
in O
Brazil O
, O
but O
also O
in O
other O
countries O
such O
as O
Argentina O
, O
Bolivia O
, O
Chile O
, O
Costa O
Rica O
, O
France O
, O
Italy O
, O
Mexico O
, O
Portugal O
, O
Spain O
, O
Thailand O
and O
Turkey O
. O

The O
goal O
of O
the O
campaign O
is O
to O
capture O
credit O
card O
data O
from O
guests O
and O
travelers O
stored O
in O
hotel O
systems O
, O
as O
well O
as O
credit O
card O
data O
received O
from O
popular O
online O
travel O
agencies O
( O
OTAs O
) O
such O
as O
Booking.com O
. O

The O
main O
attack O
vector O
is O
via O
email O
with O
crafted O
Word O
, O
Excel O
or O
PDF O
documents O
attached O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
exploit O
CVE-2017-0199 O
, O
loading O
it O
using O
VBS O
and O
PowerShell O
scripts O
and O
then O
installing O
customized O
versions O
of O
RevengeRAT B-Malware
, O
NjRAT B-Malware
, O
NanoCoreRAT B-Malware
, O
888 B-Malware
RAT I-Malware
and O
other O
custom O
malware O
such O
as O
ProCC B-Malware
in O
the O
victim O
’s O
machine O
. O

The O
group O
has O
been O
active O
since O
2015 O
, O
but O
increased O
its O
attacks O
in O
2019 O
. O

In O
our O
research O
, O
we O
were O
also O
able O
to O
track O
two O
groups O
targeting O
the O
hospitality O
sector O
, O
using O
separate O
but O
similar O
infrastructure O
, O
tools O
and O
techniques O
. O

PaloAlto O
has O
already O
written O
about O
one O
of O
them O
. O

We O
named O
the O
first O
group O
RevengeHotels B-Organization
, O
and O
the O
second O
ProCC B-Organization
. O

These O
groups O
use O
a O
lot O
of O
social O
engineering O
in O
their O
attacks O
, O
asking O
for O
a O
quote O
from O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
government O
entity O
or O
private O
company O
wanting O
to O
make O
a O
reservation O
for O
a O
large O
number O
of O
people O
. O

Their O
infrastructure O
also O
relies O
on O
the O
use O
of O
dynamic O
DNS O
services O
pointing O
to O
commercial O
hosting O
and O
self-hosted O
servers O
. O

They O
also O
sell O
credentials O
from O
the O
affected O
systems O
, O
allowing O
other O
cybercriminals O
to O
have O
remote O
access O
to O
hotel O
front O
desks O
infected O
by O
the O
campaign O
. O

We O
monitored O
the O
activities O
of O
these O
groups O
and O
the O
new O
malware O
they O
are O
creating O
for O
over O
a O
year O
. O

With O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
confidence O
, O
we O
can O
confirm O
that O
at O
least O
two O
distinct O
groups O
are O
focused O
on O
attacking O
this O
sector O
; O
there O
is O
also O
a O
third O
group O
, O
though O
it O
is O
unclear O
if O
its O
focus O
is O
solely O
on O
this O
sector O
or O
if O
carries O
out O
other O
types O
of O
attacks O
. O

One O
of O
the O
tactics O
used O
in O
operations O
by O
these O
groups O
is O
highly O
targeted O
spear-phishing O
messages O
. O

They O
register O
typo-squatting O
domains O
, O
impersonating O
legitimate O
companies O
. O

The O
emails O
are O
well O
written O
, O
with O
an O
abundance O
of O
detail O
. O

They O
explain O
why O
the O
company O
has O
chosen O
to O
book O
that O
particular O
hotel O
. O

By O
checking O
the O
sender O
information O
, O
it O
’s O
possible O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O
company O
actually O
exists O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
a O
small O
difference O
between O
the O
domain O
used O
to O
send O
the O
email O
and O
the O
real O
one O
. O

This O
spear-phishing O
message O
, O
written O
in O
Portuguese O
, O
has O
a O
malicious O
file O
attached O
misusing O
the O
name O
of O
a O
real O
attorney O
office O
, O
while O
the O
domain O
sender O
of O
the O
message O
was O
registered O
one O
day O
before O
, O
using O
a O
typo-squatting O
domain O
. O

The O
group O
goes O
further O
in O
its O
social O
engineering O
effort O
: O
to O
convince O
the O
hotel O
personnel O
about O
the O
legitimacy O
of O
their O
request O
, O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
National O
Registry O
of O
Legal O
Entities O
card O
( O
CNPJ O
) O
is O
attached O
to O
the O
quotation O
. O

The O
attached O
file O
, O
Reserva O
Advogados O
Associados.docx O
( O
Attorneys O
Associates O
Reservation.docx O
) O
, O
is O
a O
malicious O
Word O
file O
that O
drops O
a O
remote O
OLE O
object O
via O
template O
injection O
to O
execute O
macro O
code O
. O

The O
macro O
code O
inside O
the O
remote O
OLE O
document O
contains O
PowerShell O
commands O
that O
download O
and O
execute O
the O
final O
payload O
. O

In O
the O
RevengeHotels B-Organization
campaign O
, O
the O
downloaded O
files O
are O
.NET O
binaries O
protected O
with O
the O
Yoda B-Malware
Obfuscator I-Malware
. O

After O
unpacking O
them O
, O
the O
code O
is O
recognizable O
as O
the O
commercial O
RAT B-Malware
RevengeRAT B-Malware
. O

An O
additional O
module O
written O
by O
the O
group O
called O
ScreenBooking B-Malware
is O
used O
to O
capture O
credit O
card O
data O
. O

It O
monitors O
whether O
the O
user O
is O
browsing O
the O
web O
page O
. O

In O
the O
initial O
versions O
, O
back O
in O
2016 O
, O
the O
downloaded O
files O
from O
RevengeHotels B-Organization
campaigns O
were O
divided O
into O
two O
modules O
: O
a O
backdoor B-Malware
and O
a O
module O
to O
capture O
screenshots O
. O

Recently O
we O
noticed O
that O
these O
modules O
had O
been O
merged O
into O
a O
single O
backdoor O
module O
able O
to O
collect O
data O
from O
clipboard O
and O
capture O
screenshots O
. O

In O
this O
example O
, O
the O
webpage O
that O
the O
attacker O
is O
monitoring O
is O
booking.com O
( O
more O
specifically O
, O
the O
page O
containing O
the O
card O
details O
) O
. O

The O
code O
is O
specifically O
looking O
for O
data O
in O
Portuguese O
and O
English O
, O
allowing O
the O
attackers O
to O
steal O
credit O
card O
data O
from O
web O
pages O
written O
in O
these O
languages O
. O

In O
the O
ProCC B-Organization
campaigns O
, O
the O
downloaded O
files O
are O
Delphi O
binaries O
. O

The O
backdoor B-Malware
installed O
in O
the O
machine O
is O
more O
customized O
than O
that O
used O
by O
RevengeHotels B-Organization
: O
it O
’s O
developed O
from O
scratch O
and O
is O
able O
to O
collect O
data O
from O
the O
clipboard O
and O
printer O
spooler O
, O
and O
capture O
screenshots O
. O

Because O
the O
personnel O
in O
charge O
of O
confirming O
reservations O
usually O
need O
to O
pull O
credit O
card O
data O
from O
OTA O
websites O
, O
it O
’s O
possible O
to O
collect O
card O
numbers O
by O
monitoring O
the O
clipboard O
and O
the O
documents O
sent O
to O
the O
printer O
. O

According O
to O
the O
relevant O
underground O
forums O
and O
messaging O
groups O
, O
these O
criminals O
also O
infect O
front O
desk O
machines O
in O
order O
to O
capture O
credentials O
from O
the O
hotel O
administration O
software O
; O
they O
can O
then O
steal O
credit O
card O
details O
from O
it O
too O
. O

Some O
criminals O
also O
sell O
remote O
access O
to O
these O
systems O
, O
acting O
as O
a O
concierge O
for O
other O
cybercriminals O
by O
giving O
them O
permanent O
access O
to O
steal O
new O
data O
by O
themselves O
. O

Some O
Brazilian B-Organization
criminals I-Organization
tout O
credit O
card O
data O
extracted O
from O
a O
hotel O
’s O
system O
as O
high O
quality O
and O
reliable O
because O
it O
was O
extracted O
from O
a O
trusted O
source O
, O
i.e. O
, O
a O
hotel O
administration O
system O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
the O
victims O
are O
associated O
with O
the O
hospitality O
sector O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
routines O
used O
, O
we O
estimate O
that O
this O
attack O
has O
a O
global O
reach O
. O

Based O
on O
data O
extracted O
from O
Bit.ly O
statistics O
, O
we O
can O
see O
that O
potential O
victims O
from O
many O
other O
countries O
have O
at O
least O
accessed O
the O
malicious O
link O
. O

This O
data O
suggests O
that O
the O
number O
of O
countries O
with O
potential O
victims O
is O
higher O
than O
our O
telemetry O
has O
registered O
. O

RevengeHotels B-Organization

, O
revealing O
different O

using O
traditional O
RAT B-Malware

in O
the O

sector O
. O

While O
there O
is O
a O
marked O
interest O
in O

, O
our O

shows O
that O
their O
reach O
has O
extended O
to O
other O

and O
beyond O
. O

The O
use O
of O

is O
yielding O

If O
you O

Since O
2004 O
, O
Mandiant B-Organization
has O
investigated O
computer O
security O
breaches O
at O
hundreds O
of O
organizations O
around O
the O
world.The O
majority O
of O
these O
security O

actors O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
“ O
Advanced O
Persistent O
Threat O
” O
( O
APT O
) O
. O

We O
first O
published O
details O
about O
the O
APT O
in O
our O
January O
2010 O
M-Trends O
report O
. O

As O
we O
stated O
in O
there O
port O
, O
our O
position O
was O
that O
“ O
The O
Chinese O
government O
may O
authorize O
this O
activity O
, O
but O
there O
’s O
no O
way O
to O
determine O
the O
extent O
of O
its O
involvement. O


” O
Now O
, O
three O
years O
later O
, O
we O
have O
the O
evidence O
required O
to O
change O
our O
assessment O
. O

The O
details O
we O
have O
analyzed O
during O
hundreds O
of O
investigations O
convince O
us O
that O
the O
groups O
conducting O
these O
activities O
are O
based O
primarily O
in O
China O
and O
that O
the O
Chinese O
Government O
is O
aware O
of O
them O
. O

Mandiant B-Organization
continues O
to O
track O
dozens O
of O
APT O
groups O
around O
the O
world O
; O
however O
, O
this O
report O
is O
focused O
on O
the O
most O
prolific O
of O
these O
groups O
. O

We O
refer O
to O
this O
group O
as O
“ O
APT1 B-Organization
” O
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
more O
than O
20 O
APT O
groups O
with O
origins O
inChina O
. O

APT1 B-Organization
is O
a O
single O
organization O
of O
operators O
that O
has O
conducted O
a O
cyber O
espionage O
campaign O
against O
a O
broad O
range O
of O
victims O
since O
at O
least O
2006 O
. O

From O
our O
observations O
, O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prolific O
cyber O
espionage O
groups O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
sheer O
quantity O
of O
information O
stolen O
. O

The O
scale O
and O
impact O
of O
APT1 B-Organization
’s O
operations O
compelled O
us O
to O
write O
this O
report O
. O

The O
activity O
we O
have O
directly O
observed O
likely O
represents O
only O
a O
small O
fraction O
of O
the O
cyber O

that O
APT1 B-Organization

conducted O
. O

Though O
our O

group O
’s O
intrusions O
against O
nearly O
150 O
victims O
over O
seven O
years O
. O

From O
our O
unique O
vantage O
point O
responding O
to O
victims O
, O
we O
tracked O
APT1 B-Organization
back O
to O
four O
large O
networks O
in O
Shanghai O
, O
two O
of O
which O
are O
allocated O
directly O
to O
the O
Pudong O
New O
Area O
. O

We O
uncovered O
a O
substantial O
amount O
of O
APT1 B-Organization
’s O
attack O
infrastructure O
, O
command O
and O
control O
, O
and O
modus O
operandi O
( O

. O

In O
an O
effort O
to O
underscore O
there O
are O
actual O
individuals O
behind O
the O
keyboard O
, O
Mandiant B-Organization
is O
revealing O
three O
personas O
we O
have O
attributed O
to O
APT1 B-Organization
. O

These O
operators O
, O
like O
soldiers O
, O
may O
merely O
be O
following O
orders O
given O
to O
them O
by O
others O
. O

Our O
analysis O
has O
led O
us O
to O
conclude O
that O
APT1 B-Organization
is O
likely O
government-sponsored O
and O
one O
of O
the O
most O
persistent O
of O
China O
’s O
cyber O
threat O
actors O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
APT1 B-Organization
is O
able O
to O
wage O
such O
a O
long-running O
and O
extensive O
cyber O
espionage O
campaign O
in O
large O
part O
because O
it O
receives O
direct O
government O
support O
. O

In O
seeking O
to O
identify O
the O
organization O
behind O
this O
activity O
,our O
research O
found O
that O
People O
’s O
Liberation O
Army O
( O
PLA O
’s O
) O
Unit O
61398 O
is O
similar O
to O
APT1 B-Organization
in O
its O
mission O
, O
capabilities O
, O
and O
resources O
. O

PLA O
Unit O
61398 O
is O
also O
located O
in O
precisely O
the O
same O
area O
from O
which O
APT1 B-Organization
activity O
appears O
to O
originate O
. O

APT1 B-Organization
is O
believed O
to O
be O
the O
2nd O
Bureau O
of O
the O
People O

known O
by O
its O

as O
Unit O
61398 O
. O

The O
nature O
of O
“ O
Unit O
61398 O
’s O
” O
work O
is O
considered O
by O
China O
to O
be O
a O

it O
engages O
in O
harmful O

” O
Unit O
61398 O
is O
partially O

is O
located O
in O
the O
Pudong O

The O
central O

in O
this O
compound O
is O
a O
130,663 O
square O
foot O
facility O
that O
is O
12 O
stories O
high O
and O
was O
built O
in O
early O
2007 O
. O

APT1 B-Organization
has O
systematically O
stolen O
hundreds O
of O
terabytes O
of O
data O
from O
at O
least O
141 O
organizations O
, O
and O
has O
demonstrated O
the O
capability O
and O
intent O
to O
steal O
from O
dozens O
of O
organizations O
simultaneously O
. O

Since O
2006 O
, O
Mandiant B-Organization
has O
observed O
APT1 B-Organization
compromise O
141 O
companies O
spanning O
20 O
major O
industries O
. O

APT1 B-Organization
has O
a O
well-defined O
attack O
methodology O
, O
honed O
over O
years O
and O
designed O
to O
steal O
large O
volumes O
of O
valuable O
intellectual O
property O
. O

Once O
APT1 B-Organization
has O
established O
access O
, O
they O
periodically O
revisit O
the O
victim O
’s O
network O
over O
several O
months O
or O
years O
and O
steal O
broad O
categories O
of O
intellectual O
property O
, O
including O
technology O
blueprints O
, O
proprietary O
manufacturing O
processes O
, O
test O

documents O
, O
partnership O
agreements O
, O
and O
emails O
and O
contact O
lists O
from O
victim O
organizations O
’ O
leadership O
. O

APT1 B-Organization
uses O
some O
tools O
and O
techniques O
that O
we O
have O
not O
yet O
observed O
being O
used O
by O
other O
groups O
including O
two O
utilities O
designed O
to O
steal O
email O
— O
GETMAIL B-Malware
and O
MAPIGET B-Malware
. O

Establishing O
a O
foothold O
involves O
actions O
that O
ensure O
control O
of O
the O
target O
network O
’s O
systems O
from O
outside O
the O
network O
. O

APT1 B-Organization
establishes O
a O
foothold O
once O
email O
recipients O
open O
a O
malicious O
file O
and O
a O
backdoor O
is O
subsequently O
installed O
. O

A O
backdoor O
is O
software O
that O
allows O
an O
intruder O
to O
send O
commands O
to O
the O
system O
remotely O
. O

In O
almost O
every O
case O
, O
APT O
backdoors O
initiate O
outbound O
connections O
to O
the O
intruder O
’s O
“ O
command O
and O
control O
” O
( O
C2 O
) O
server O
. O

APT O
intruders O
employ O
this O
tactic O
because O
while O
network O
firewalls O
are O
generally O
adept O
at O
keeping O
malware O
outside O
the O
network O
from O
initiating O
communication O
with O
systems O
inside O
the O
network O
, O
they O
are O
less O
reliable O
at O
keeping O
malware O
that O
is O
already O
inside O
the O
network O
from O
communicating O
to O
systems O
outside O
. O

While O
APT1 B-Organization
intruders O
occasionally O
use O
publicly O
available O
backdoors O
such O
as O
Poison B-Malware
Ivy I-Malware
and O
Gh0st B-Malware
RAT I-Malware
, O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
time O
they O
use O
what O
appear O
to O
be O
their O
own O
custom O
backdoors O
. O

We O
will O
describe O
APT1 B-Organization
’s O
backdoors O
in O
two O
categories O
: O
“ O
Beachhead O
Backdoors O
” O
and O
“ O
Standard O
Backdoors. O


” O
backdoors O
are O
typically O
minimally O
featured O
. O

They O
offer O
the O
attacker O
a O
toe-hold O
to O
perform O
simple O
tasks O
like O
retrieve O
files O
, O
gather O
basic O
system O
information O
and O
trigger O
the O
execution O
of O
other O
more O
significant O
capabilities O
such O
as O
a O
standard O
backdoor O
. O

APT1 B-Organization
’s O
beachhead O
backdoors O
are O
usually O
what O
we O
call O
WEBC2 B-Malware
backdoors I-Malware
. O

WEBC2 B-Malware
backdoors I-Malware
are O
probably O
the O
most O
well-known O
kind O
of O
APT1 B-Organization
backdoor O
, O
and O
are O
the O
reason O
why O
some O
security O
companies O
refer O
to O
APT1 B-Organization
as O
the O
“ O
Comment O
Crew. O


” O
A O
WEBC2 B-Malware
backdoor I-Malware
is O
designed O
to O
retrieve O
a O
webpage O
from O
a O
C2 O
server O
. O

It O
expects O
the O
webpage O
to O
contain O
special O
HTML O
tags O
; O
the O
backdoor O
will O
attempt O
to O
interpret O
the O
data O
between O
the O
tags O
as O
commands O
. O

Older O
versions O
of O
WEBC2 B-Malware
read O
data O
between O
HTML O
comments O
, O
though O
over O
time O
WEBC2 B-Malware
variants O
have O
evolved O
to O
read O
data O
contained O
within O
other O
types O
of O
tags O
. O

From O
direct O
observation O
, O
we O
can O
confirm O
that O
APT1 B-Organization
was O
using O
WEBC2 B-Malware
backdoors I-Malware
as O
early O
as O
July O
2006 O
. O

However O
, O
the O
first O
compile O
time35 O
we O
have O
for O
WEBC2 B-Malware
is O
2004-01-23 O
, O
suggesting O
that O
APT1 B-Organization
has O
been O
crafting O
WEBC2 B-Malware
backdoors I-Malware
since O
early O
2004 O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
400+ O
samples O
of O
WEBC2 B-Malware
variants O
that O
we O
have O
accumulated O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
APT1 B-Organization
has O
direct O
access O
to O
developers O
who O
have O
continually O
released O
new O
WEBC2 B-Malware
variants O
for O
over O
six O
years O
. O

WEBC2 B-Malware
backdoors I-Malware
are O
often O
packaged O
with O
spear O
phishing O
emails O
. O

Once O
installed O
, O
APT1 B-Organization
intruders O
have O
the O
option O
to O
tell O
victim O
systems O
to O
download O
and O
execute O
additional O
malicious O
software O
of O
their O
choice O
. O

WEBC2 B-Malware
backdoors I-Malware
work O
for O
their O
intended O
purpose O
, O
but O
they O
generally O
have O
fewer O
features O
than O
the O
“ O
Standard O
Backdoors O
” O
described O
below O
. O

The O
standard O
, O
non-WEBC2 B-Malware
APT1 B-Organization
backdoor O
typically O
communicates O
using O
the O
HTTP O
protocol O
( O
to O
blend O
in O
with O
legitimate O
web O
traffic O
) O
or O
a O
custom O
protocol O
that O
the O
malware O
authors O
designed O
themselves O
. O

These O
backdoors O
give O
APT O
intruders O
a O
laundry O
list O
of O
ways O
to O
control O
victim O
systems O
. O

The O
BISCUIT B-Malware
backdoor I-Malware
( O
so O
named O
for O
the O
command O
“ O
bdkzt B-Malware
” O
) O
is O
an O
illustrative O
example O
of O
the O
range O
of O
commands O
that O
APT1 B-Organization
has O
built O
into O
its O
“ O
standard O
” O
backdoors O
. O

APT1 B-Organization
has O
used O
and O
steadily O
modified O
BISCUIT B-Malware
since O
as O
early O
as O
2007 O
and O
continues O
to O
use O
it O
presently O
. O

Some O
APT O
backdoors O
attempt O
to O
mimic O
legitimate O
Internet O
traffic O
other O
than O
the O
HTTP O
protocol O
. O

When O
network O
defenders O
see O
the O
communications O
between O
these O
backdoors O
and O
their O
C2 O
servers O
, O
they O
might O
easily O
dismiss O
them O
as O
legitimate O
network O
traffic O
. O


APT1 B-Organization
. O

APT1 B-Organization
maintains O
an O
extensive O
infrastructure O
of O
computers O
around O
the O
world O
. O

We O
have O
evidence O
suggesting O
that O
APT1 B-Organization
manually O
controls O
thousands O
of O
systems O
in O
support O
of O
their O
attacks O
, O
and O
have O
directly O
observed O
their O
control O
over O
hundreds O
of O
these O
systems O
. O

Although O
they O
control O
systems O
in O
dozens O
of O
countries O
, O
their O
attacks O
originate O
from O
four O
large O
networks O
in O
Shanghai O
— O
two O
of O
which O
are O
allocated O
directly O
to O
the O
Pudong O
New O
Area O
, O
the O
home O
of O
Unit O
61398 O
. O

The O
sheer O
number O
of O
APT1 B-Organization
IP O
addresses O
concentrated O
in O
these O
Shanghai O
ranges O
, O
coupled O
with O
Simplified O
Chinese O
keyboard O
layout O
settings O
on O
APT1 B-Organization
’s O
attack O
systems O
, O
betrays O
the O
true O
location O
and O
language O
of O
the O
operators O
. O

To O
help O
manage O
the O
vast O
number O
of O
systems O
they O
control O
, O
APT1 B-Organization
has O
registered O
hundreds O
of O
domain O
names O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
which O
also O
point O
to O
a O
Shanghai O
locale O
. O

The O
domain O
names O
and O
IP O
addresses O
together O
comprise O
APT1 B-Organization
’s O
command O
and O
control O
framework O
which O
they O
manage O
in O
concert O
to O
camouflage O
their O
true O
origin O
from O
their O
English O
speaking O
targets O
. O

As O
covered O
in O
the O
previous O
“ O
Attack O
Lifecycle O
” O
section O
, O
WEBC2 B-Malware
backdoor I-Malware
variants O
download O
and O
interpret O
data O
stored O
between O
tags O
in O
HTML O
pages O
as O
commands O
. O

They O
usually O
download O
HTML O
pages O
from O
a O
system O
within O
APT1 B-Organization
’s O
hop O
infrastructure O
. O

We O
have O
observed O
APT1 B-Organization
intruders O
logging O
in O
to O
WEBC2 B-Malware
servers O
and O
manually O
editing O
the O
HTML O
pages O
that O
backdoors O
will O
download O
. O

Because O
the O
commands O
are O
usually O
encoded O
and O
difficult O
to O
spell O
from O
memory O
, O
APT1 B-Organization
intruders O
typically O
do O
not O
type O
these O
strings O
, O
but O
instead O
copy O
and O
paste O
them O
into O
the O
HTML O
files O
. O

They O
likely O
generate O
the O
encoded O
commands O
on O
their O
own O
systems O
before O
pasting O
them O
in O
to O
an O
HTML O
file O
hosted O
by O
the O
hop O
point O
. O

For O
example O
, O
we O
observed O
an O
APT O
attacker O
pasting O
the O
string O
“ O
czo1NA== O
” O
into O
an O
HTML O
page O
. O

That O
string O
is O
the O
base64 O
encoded O
version O
of O
“ O
s O
: O
54 O
” O
, O
meaning O
“ O
sleep O
for O
54 O
minutes O
” O
( O
or O
hours O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
particular O
backdoor O
) O
. O

In O
lieu O
of O
manually O
editing O
an O
HTML O
file O
on O
a O
hop O
point O
, O
we O
have O
also O
observed O
APT1 B-Organization
intruders O
uploading O
new O
( O
already-edited O
) O
HTML O
files O
. O

When O
APT1 B-Organization
attackers O
are O
not O
using O
WEBC2 B-Malware
, O
they O
require O
a O
“ O
command O
and O
control O
” O
( O
C2 O
) O
user O
interface O
so O
they O
can O
issue O
commands O
to O
the O
backdoor O
. O

This O
interface O
sometimes O
runs O
on O
their O
personal O
attack O
system O
, O
which O
is O
typically O
in O
Shanghai O
. O

In O
these O
instances O
, O
when O
a O
victim O
backdoor O
makes O
contact O
with O
a O
hop O
, O
the O
communications O
need O
to O
be O
forwarded O
from O
the O
hop O
to O
the O
intruder O
’s O
Shanghai O
system O
so O
the O
backdoor O
can O
talk O
to O
the O
C2 O
server O
software O
. O

We O
have O
observed O
767 O
separate O
instances O
in O
which O
APT1 B-Organization
intruders O
used O
the O
publicly O
available O
“ O
HUC O
Packet O
Transmit O
Tool O
” O
or O
HTRAN O
on O
a O
hop O
. O

As O
always O
, O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
these O
uses O
are O
confirmed O
uses O
, O
and O
likely O
represent O
only O
a O
small O
fraction O
of O
APT1 B-Organization
’s O
total O
activity O
. O

The O
HTRAN O
utility O
is O
merely O
a O
middle-man O
, O
facilitating O
connections O
between O
the O
victim O
and O
the O
attacker O
who O
is O
using O
the O
hop O
point O
. O

Typical O
use O
of O
HTRAN O
is O
fairly O
simple O
: O
the O
attacker O
must O
specify O
the O
originating O
IP O
address O
( O
of O
his O
or O
her O
workstation O
in O
Shanghai O
) O
, O
and O
a O
port O
on O
which O
to O
accept O
connections O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
following O
command O
, O
which O
was O
issued O
by O
an O
APT1 B-Organization
actor O
, O
will O
listen O
for O
incoming O
connections O
on O
port O
443 O
on O
the O
hop O
and O
automatically O
proxy O
them O
to O
the O
Shanghai O
IP O
address O
58.247.242.254 O
on O
port O
443 O
. O

Occasionally O
, O
APT1 B-Organization
attackers O
have O
installed O
C2 O
server O
components O
on O
systems O
in O
their O
hop O
infrastructure O
rather O
than O
forwarding O
connections O
back O
to O
C2 O
servers O
in O
Shanghai O
. O

In O
these O
instances O
they O
do O
not O
need O
to O
use O
a O
proxy O
tool O
like O
HTRAN O
to O
interact O
with O
victim O
systems O
. O

However O
, O
it O
does O
mean O
that O
the O
intruders O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
interface O
with O
the O
( O
often O
graphical O
) O
C2 O
server O
software O
running O
on O
the O
hop O
. O

We O
have O
observed O
APT1 B-Organization
intruders O
log O
in O
to O
their O
hop O
point O
, O
start O
the O
C2 O
server O
, O
wait O
for O
incoming O
connections O
, O
and O
then O
proceed O
to O
give O
commands O
to O
victim O
systems O
. O

WEBC2 B-Malware
variants O
may O
include O
a O
server O
component O
that O
provides O
a O
simple O
C2 O
interface O
to O
the O
intruder O
. O

This O
saves O
the O
intruder O
from O
having O
to O
manually O
edit O
webpages O
. O

That O
is O
, O
this O
server O
component O
receives O
connections O
from O
victim O
backdoors O
, O
displays O
them O
to O
the O
intruder O
, O
and O
then O
translates O
the O
intruder O
’s O
commands O
into O
HTML O
tags O
that O
the O
victim O
backdoors O
read O
. O

In O
the O
last O
two O
years O
alone O
, O
we O
have O
confirmed O
937 O
APT1 B-Organization

However O
, O
we O
have O

This O

is O
notable O
for O
targeting O
East O
Asian O
governments O
, O
electronics O
manufacturers O
, O
and O
a O
telecommunications O
company O
. O

The O
IXESHE B-Organization
campaign O
makes O
use O
of O
targeted O
emails O
with O
malicious O
attachments O
to O
compromise O
victims O
’ O
systems O
. O

The O
emails O
are O
often O
tailored O
for O
specific O
victims O
and O
contain O
malicious O
attachments O
that O
are O
almost O
always O
“ O
weaponized O
” O
.PDF O
files O
with O
known O
exploits O
that O
drop O
malware O
executables O
onto O
targeted O
systems O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
IXESHE B-Organization
attackers O
conducted O
two O
specific O
attacks O
that O
leveraged O
zero-day B-Vulnerability
exploits—one O
in O
2009 O
and O
another O
in O
2011 O
. O

The O
IXESHE B-Organization
attackers O
almost O
always O
make O
use O
of O
compromised O
servers O
as O
command-and-control O
( O
C&C O
) O
servers O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
compromised O
servers O
are O
hosted O
on O
target O
organizations O
’ O
networks O
after O
successful O
infiltration O
so O
the O
attackers O
can O
increase O
their O
control O
of O
the O
victims O
’ O
infrastructure O
. O

Using O
this O
approach O
, O
the O
attackers O
amassed O
at O
least O
60 O
C&C O
servers O
over O
time O
. O

This O
technique O
also O
allows O
the O
attackers O
to O
cover O
their O
tracks O
, O
as O
having O
the O
C&C O
server O

The O
attackers O
’ O
deliberate O
use O
of O
compromised O
machines O
and O
dynamic O
Domain O

System O
( O

) O

allows O
them O
to O
hide O

were O
able O
to O
develop O

the O
IXESHE B-Organization

. O

The O
malware O
samples O
used O
in O
this O

were O
not O

do O
give O
the O

almost O

Most O
of O
the O
IP O

of O
IXESHE B-Organization

are O

which O
made O
it O
difficult O

These O

it O
is O
unclear O
if O
APT12 B-Organization

, O
the O

shared O
several O
traits O
with O
the O
RIPTIDE B-Malware

that O
we O
have O
attributed O
to O
APT12 B-Organization
. O

From O
October O
2012 O

May O
2014, O
FireEye B-Organization
observed O

an O

the O
RIPTIDE B-Malware

The O

that O
the O

May O
2014 O
. O

Following O
the O

article O
, O
FireEye B-Organization
observed O
a O
distinct O
change O
in O
RIPTIDE B-Malware

We O
suspect O
this O
change O
was O
a O
direct O
result O
of O
the O
Arbor O

post O
in O

to O
decrease O

The O
changes O
to O

were O
significant O

Ixeshe O
had O
not O
evolved O
since O
at O
least O
December O
2011 O
. O

Cybercriminals O
are O
constantly O
evolving O
and O
adapting O
in O
their O
attempts O
to O
bypass O
computer O
network O
defenses O
. O

But O
, O
larger O
, O
more O
successful O
threat O
actors O
tend O
to O
evolve O
at O
a O
slower O
rate O
. O

As O
long O
as O
these O
actors O
regularly O
achieve O
their O
objective O
( O
stealing O
sensitive O
data O
) O
, O
they O
are O
not O
motivated O
to O
update O
or O
rethink O
their O
techniques O
, O
tactics O
, O
or O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
. O

These O
threat O
actors O
’ O
tactics O
follow O
the O
same O
principles O
of O
evolution O
– O
successful O
techniques O
propagate O
, O
and O
unsuccessful O
ones O
are O
abandoned O
. O

Attackers O
do O
not O
change O
their O
approach O
unless O
an O
external O
force O
or O
environmental O
shift O
compels O
them O
to O
. O

As O
the O
old O
saying O
goes O
: O
If O
it O
ain’t O
broke O
, O
don’t O
fix O
it O
. O

So O
when O
a O
larger O
, O
successful O
threat O
actor O
changes O
up O
tactics O
, O
the O
move O
always O
piques O
our O
attention O
. O

Naturally O
, O
our O
first O
priority O
is O
ensuring O
that O
we O
detect O
the O
new O
or O
altered O
TTPs O
. O

But O
we O
also O
attempt O
to O
figure O
out O
why O
the O
adversary O
changed O
— O
what O
broke? O
— O
so O
that O
we O
can O
predict O
if O
and O
when O
they O
will O
change O
again O
in O
the O
future O
. O

We O
observed O
an O
example O
of O
this O
phenomenon O
around O
May O
. O

About O
four O
months O
after O
The O
New O
York O
Times O
publicized O
an O
attack O
on O
its O
network O
, O
the O
attackers O
behind O
the O
intrusion O
deployed O
updated O
versions O
of O
their O
Backdoor.APT.Aumlib O
and O
Backdoor.APT.Ixeshe O
malware O
families O
. O

The O
previous O
versions O
of O
Aumlib B-Malware
had O
not O
changed O
since O
at O
least O
May O
2011, O
and O
Ixeshe O
had O
not O
evolved O
since O
at O
least O
December O
2011 O
. O

We O
cannot O
say O
for O
sure O
whether O
the O
attackers O
were O
responding O
to O
the O
scrutiny O
they O
received O
in O
the O
wake O
of O
the O
episode O
. O

But O
we O
do O
know O
the O
change O
was O
sudden O
. O

Akin O
to O
turning O
a O
battleship O
, O
retooling O
TTPs O
of O
large O
threat O
actors O
is O
formidable O
. O

Such O
a O
move O
requires O
recoding O
malware O
, O
updating O
infrastructure O
, O
and O
possibly O
retraining O
workers O
on O
new O
processes O
. O

The O
following O

the O
changes O

attribution O
of O

still O
uncertain O

we O
attribute O
the O

to O
the O
China O

APT O
group O
that O
we O
refer O
to O

the O

of O
the O

as O
well O
as O
overlaps O
in O
previously O
observed O
targeting O
and O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
. O

Taiwanese O
citizens O
will O
go O
to O
the O
polls O
on O
January O
16 O
, O
2016 O
, O
to O
choose O
a O
new O
President O
and O
legislators O
. O

According O
to O
recent O
opinion O
polls O
, O
the O
Democratic O
Progressive O
Party O
( O
DPP O
) O
candidate O
Tsai O
Ing-wen O
is O
leading O
her O
opponents O
and O
is O
widely O
expected O
to O
win O
the O
election O
. O

The O
DPP O
is O
part O
of O
the O
pan-green O
coalition O
that O
favors O
Taiwanese O
independence O
over O
reunification O
with O
the O
mainland O
, O
and O
the O
party O
’s O
victory O
would O
represent O
a O
shift O
away O
from O
the O
ruling O
Kuomintang O
’s O
closer O
ties O
with O
the O
PRC O
. O

Since O
1949 O
, O
Beijing O
has O
claimed O
Taiwan O
as O
a O
part O
of O
China O
and O
strongly O
opposes O
any O
action O
toward O
independence O
. O

The O
Chinese O
government O
is O
therefore O
concerned O
whether O
a O
DPP O
victory O
might O
weaken O
the O
commercial O
and O
tourism O
ties O
between O
China O
and O
Taiwan O
, O
or O
even O
drive O
Taiwan O
closer O
to O
independence O
. O

In O
2005 O
, O
the O
Chinese O
government O
passed O
an O
“ O
anti-secession O
” O
law O
that O
signified O
its O
intention O
to O
use O
“ O
non-peaceful O
” O
means O
to O
stymie O
any O
Taiwanese O
attempt O
to O
secede O
from O
China O
. O

APT16 B-Organization
actors O
sent O
spear O
phishing O
emails O
to O
two O
Taiwanese O
media O
organization O
addresses O
and O
three O
webmail O
addresses O
. O

The O
message O
subject O
read O
“ O
DPP O
’s O
Contact O
Information O
Update O
” O
, O
apparently O
targeting O
those O
interested O
in O
contact O
information O
for O
DPP O
members O
or O
politicians O
. O

The O
Chinese O
government O
would O
benefit O
from O
improved O
insight O
into O
local O
media O
coverage O
of O
Taiwanese O
politics O
, O
both O
to O
better O
anticipate O
the O
election O
outcome O
and O
to O
gather O
additional O
intelligence O
on O
politicians O
, O
activists O
, O
and O
others O
who O
interact O
with O
journalists O
. O

This O
tactic O
is O
not O
without O
precedent O
; O
in O
2013 O
, O
the O
New O
York O
Times O
revealed O
it O
had O
been O
the O
target O
of O
China O
based O
actors O
shortly O
after O
it O
reported O
on O
the O
alleged O
mass O
accumulation O
of O
wealth O
by O
then-Prime O
Minister O
Wen O
Jiabao O
and O
his O
family O
. O

The O
actors O
likely O
sought O
information O
on O
the O
newspaper O
’s O
sources O
in O
China O
, O
who O
could O
be O
silenced O
by O
the O
government O
. O

Compromising O
these O
Taiwanese O
news O
organizations O
would O
also O
allow O
the O
actors O
to O
gain O
access O
to O
informants O
or O
other O
protected O
sources O
, O
who O
might O
then O
be O
targeted O
for O
further O
intelligence O
collection O
or O
even O
retribution O
. O

The O
webmail O
addresses O
, O
while O
unknown O
, O
were O
possibly O
the O
personal-use O
addresses O
of O
the O
individuals O
whose O
corporate O
domain O
emails O
were O
targeted O
. O

As O
corporate O
networks O
become O
more O
secure O
and O
users O
become O
more O
vigilant O
, O
personal O
accounts O
can O
still O
offer O
a O
means O
to O
bypass O
security O
systems O
. O

This O
tactic O
exploits O
users O
’ O
reduced O
vigilance O
when O
reading O
their O
own O
personal O
email O
, O
even O
when O
using O
corporate O
IT O
equipment O
to O
do O
so O
. O

On O
the O
same O
date O
that O
APT16 B-Organization
targeted O

It O
is O
possible O

although O
not O
confirmed O
, O
that O
APT16 B-Organization
was O
also O
responsible O
for O
targeting O
this O

In O
the O

would O
modify O
easily O

as O
observed O
in O
the O
China O

APT1 B-Organization

WEBC2 B-Malware

Now O
, O
threat O

are O
using O
well-known O
websites—that O
they O
do O
not O
need O
to O
compromise O
to O
host O
C2 O
IP O

. O

They O
simply O
use O
the O

legitimate O
purposes O
, O
such O
as O
posting O

or O
creating O

APT17 B-Organization
went O
further O
to O
obfuscate O
their O

and O
employed O
a O
multi-layered O
approach O
for O
the O
malware O
to O
finally O
beacon O

They O
used O
legitimate O
infrastructure—the O
ability O
to O
post O
or O
create O
comments O
on O
forums O
and O

embed O
a O

that O
the O

would O
decode O
to O
find O
and O
communicate O
with O
the O
true O
C2 O
IP O

This O
additional O
obfuscation O
puts O
yet O
another O
layer O
between O
APT17 B-Organization
and O
the O
security O
professionals O
attempting O
to O
chase O
them O
down O
. O

This O
BLACKCOFFEE B-Malware
variant O
contains O
one O

more O
URLs O
that O
link O
to O
the O
biography O

of O
attacker-created O
profiles O
as O
well O
as O
forum O

that O
contain O
comments O
from O
those O

profiles O
. O

A O
URL O
is O
randomly O
selected O
and O
the O
malware O
searches O
at O
that O
location O
for O
an O

IP O
address O
located O
between O
two O
tags O
, O
“ O
@MICR0S0FT O
” O
and O
“ O

with O
the O

If O
the O

the O

to O
hire O
remote O
pentesters O
, O
developers O
and O

to O
participate O
in O
their O
malicious O

The O
main O
goal O
behind O
its O
malicious O
activities O
was O
to O
steal O
financial O

as O
the O

to O
believe O
that O
this O

had O
remained O
active O
despite O
the O
2018 O

. O

In O

, O
during O

we O
discovered O
certain O

has O
been O
able O
to O
retrieve O
some O
of O
these O

. O

The O
spear O
phishing O
campaigns O
were O
remarkably O
sophisticated O
from O
a O
social O
engineering O
perspective O
. O

In O
various O
cases O
, O
the O

exchanged O
numerous O
messages O
with O
their O
victims O
for O
weeks O
before O
sending O
their O
malicious O

The O
emails O
were O
efficient O
social-engineering O
attempts O
that O
appealed O
to O
a O
vast O
number O
of O
human O
emotions O
( O
fear O
, O
stress O
, O
anger O
, O

) O
to O
elicit O
a O

from O
their O

One O
of O
the O
domains O
used O
by O
the O
attackers O
in O
their O
2018 O
campaign O
of O
spear O

contained O
more O
than O
130 O
email O

, O
leading O
us O
to O
think O
that O
more O
than O
130 O
companies O
had O
been O
targeted O
by O
the O
end O
of O
2018 O
. O

We O
have O
seen O
two O
types O
of O
documents O
sent O
to O
victims O
in O
these O
spear O
phishing O
campaigns O
. O

The O
first O
one O
exploits O
the O

about O
the O

, O
and O
the O

of O
Microsoft O

. O

The O
second O
one O
, O
which O
in O
many O
cases O
is O
an O
Office O
document O
protected O
with O
a O
trivial O
password O
, O
such O
as O
“ O

, O
uses O

In O
various O
cases O
, O
the O

Interestingly O
, O
following O
some O
open-source O

, O
the O
FIN7 B-Organization

seems O
to O
have O
developed O
a O

Moreover O
, O
the O

The O
GRIFFON B-Malware
implant O
is O
a O
lightweight O
JScript O
validator-style O
implant O
without O
any O
persistence O
mechanism O
. O

The O
malware O
is O
designed O
for O
receiving O
modules O
to O
be O
executed O
in-memory O
and O
sending O
the O
results O
to O
C2s O
. O

We O
were O
able O
to O
obtain O
four O
different O
modules O
during O
the O
investigation O
. O

The O
first O
module O
downloaded O
by O
the O
GRIFFON B-Malware
malware O
to O
the O
victim’s O
computer O
is O
an O
information-gathering O
JScript O
, O
which O
allows O
the O
cybercriminals O
to O
understand O
the O
context O
of O
the O
infected O
workstation O
. O

This O
module O
mainly O
relies O
on O
WMI O
and O
Windows B-System
objects O
to O
deliver O
results O
, O
which O
will O
be O
sent O
back O
to O
the O
operators O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
more O
than O
20 O
artifacts O
are O
retrieved O
from O
the O
system O
by O
this O
implant O
during O
the O
reconnaissance O
stage O
, O
from O
the O
date O
and O
time O
of O
operating O
system O
installation O
and O
membership O
in O
a O
Windows B-System
domain O
to O
a O
list O
of O
and O
the O
resolutions O
of O
the O
workstation’s O
monitors O
. O

The O
second O
module O
is O
used O
by O
the O
operators O
to O
execute O
an O
obfuscated O
PowerShell O
script O
, O
which O
contains O
a O
Meterpreter O
downloader O
widely O
known O
as O
“ O
Tinymet O
“ O
. O

This O
downloader O
, O
seen O
in O
past O
FIN7 B-Organization
campaigns O
, O
downloads O
a O
one-byte O
XOR O
encrypted O
( O
eg. O


with O
the O
key O
equal O
to O
0x50 O
or O
0x51 O
) O
piece O
of O
meterpreter O
shellcode O
to O
execute O
. O

The O
third O
module O
allows O
the O
operators O
to O
take O
a O
screenshot O
of O
the O
remote O
system O
. O

To O
do O
that O
, O
it O
also O
drops O
a O
PowerShell O
script O
on O
the O
workstation O
to O
execute O
. O

The O
script O
executes O
an O
open-source O
.NET O
class O
used O
for O
taking O
a O
screenshot O
. O

The O
resulting O
screenshot O
is O
saved O
at O
“ O
%TMP%/image.png O
” O
, O
sent O
back O
to O
the O
attackers O
by O
the O
GRIFFON B-Malware
implant O
and O
then O
deleted O
. O

The O
last O
retrieved O
module O
is O
a O
persistence O
module O
. O

If O
the O
victim O
appears O
valuable O
to O
the O
attackers O
, O
a O
GRIFFON B-Malware
implant O
installer O
is O
pushed O
to O
the O
victim’s O
workstation O
. O

This O
module O
stores O
another O
instance O
of O
the O
GRIFFON B-Malware
implant O
inside O
the O
registry O
to O
achieve O
persistence O
. O

Here O
is O
a O
PowerLinks O
style O
method O
used O
by O
the O
attackers O
to O
achieve O
persistence O
and O
execute O
the O
GRIFFON B-Malware
implant O
at O
each O
user O
logon O
. O

The O
new O
GRIFFON B-Malware
implant O
is O
written O
to O
the O
hard O
drive O
before O
each O
execution O
, O
limiting O
the O
“ O
file-less O
” O
aspect O
of O
this O
method O
. O

Through O
its O
light O
weight O
and O
modular O
architecture O
, O
the O
GRIFFON B-Malware
implant O
is O
the O
perfect O
validator O
. O

Even O
though O
we O
have O
been O
able O
to O
retrieve O
four O
different O
modules O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
FIN7 B-Organization
operators O
have O
more O
modules O
in O
their O
toolsets O
for O
achieving O
their O
objectives O
on O
the O
victim’s O
workstation O
. O

Attackers O
make O
mistakes O
, O
and O
FIN7 B-Organization
are O
no O
exception O
. O

The O
major O
error O
made O
by O
its O
operators O
allowed O
us O
to O
follow O
the O
command O
and O
control O
server O
of O
the O
GRIFFON B-Malware
implant O
last O
year O
. O

In O
order O
to O
trick O
blue O
teams O
and O
other O
DFIR O
analysts O
, O
the O
operators O
created O
fake O
HTTP O
302 O
redirection O
to O
various O
Google O
services O
on O
their O
C2s O
servers O
. O

This O
error O
allowed O
us O
to O
follow O
the O
infrastructure O
week O
by O
week O
, O
until O
an O
individual O
pushed O
on O
Twitter O
the O
heuristic O
to O
track O
their O
C2 O
at O
the O
end O
of O
December O
2018 O
. O

A O
few O
days O
after O
the O
tweet O
, O
in O
January O
2019 O
, O
the O
operators O
changed O
their O
landing O
page O
in O
order O
to O
prevent O
this O
type O
of O
tracking O
against O
their O
infrastructure O
. O

During O
the O
investigation O
related O
to O
the O
GRIFFON B-Malware
infrastructure O
, O
we O
found O
a O
strange O
overlap O
between O
the O
WHOIS O
record O
of O
an O
old O
GRIFFON B-Malware
C2 O
and O
the O
website O
of O
a O
fake O
company O
. O

According O
to O
the O
website O
, O
that O
domain O
supposedly O
belongs O
to O
a O
legitimate O
security O
company O
“ O
fully O
owned O
by O
the O

” O
( O

, O
but O
the O
address O
says O
the O
company O
is O
located O
in O
Trump O
Tower O
, O
in O
New O

. O

Given O
FIN7 B-Organization
’s O
previous O
use O
of O
false O
security O
companies O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
look O
deeper O
into O
this O
one O
. O

As O
we O
were O
looking O
at O
the O
content O
of O
the O
website O
, O
it O
became O
evident O
that O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
text O
used O
was O
lifted O
from O
legitimate O
security-company O
websites O
. O

Phrases O

the O
FIN7 B-Organization
threat O

to O
hire O
new O
people O
as O

During O
our O

we O
found O
various O
job O

with O
the O

on O
freelance O

While O
tracking O
numerous O

on O
a O
daily O
basis O
during O
the O
final O
days O
of O
2018 O
and O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
2019 O
, O
we O
discovered O
various O
activity O
clusters O
sharing O
certain O
TTPs O
associated O
with O
the O
FIN7 B-Organization
intrusion O
set O
. O

The O
link O
between O
these O
threat O
actors O
and O
FIN7 B-Organization
is O
still O
weak O
, O
but O
we O
decided O
to O
disclose O
a O
few O
hints O
regarding O
these O
in O
this O
blog O
post O
. O

In O
his O
history O
, O
FIN7 B-Organization
has O
overlapped O
several O
times O
with O
Cobalt O
in O
terms O
of O
TTPs O
. O

This O
activity O
cluster O
, O
which O
Kaspersky O
Lab O
has O
followed O
for O
a O
few O
years O
, O
uses O
various O
implants O
for O
targeting O
mainly O
banks O
, O
and O
developers O
of O
banking O
and O
money O
processing O
software O
solutions O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
2018 O
, O
the O
cluster O
started O
to O
use O
not O
only O
CobaltStrike O
but O
also O
Powershell O
Empire O
in O
order O
to O
gain O
a O
foothold O
on O
the O
victims’ O
networks O
. O

After O
a O
successful O
penetration O
, O
it O
uses O
its O
own O
backdoors O
and O
the O
CobaltStrike O
framework O
or O
Powershell O

to O
hop O
to O
interesting O
parts O
of O
the O
network O
, O
where O
it O
can O
monetize O
its O

. O

FIN7 B-Organization
’s O
last O
campaigns O
were O
targeting O
banks O
in O
Europe O
and O
Central O
America O
. O

This O
threat O
actor O
stole O
suspected O
of O
stealing O
€13 O
million O
from O
Bank O
of O
Valetta O
, O
Malta O
earlier O
this O
year O
. O

A O
few O
interesting O
overlaps O
in O
recent O
FIN7 B-Organization
campaigns O
: O
Both O
used O
macros O
to O
copy O
wscript.exe O
to O
another O
file O
, O
which O
began O
with O
“ O
ms O
” O
( O
mses.exe O
– O
FIN7 B-Organization
, O
msutil.exe O
– O
EmpireMonkey B-Malware
) O
. O

Both O
executed O
a O
JScript O
file O
named O
“ O
error O
” O
in O
%TEMP% O
( O
Errors.txt O
in O
the O
case O
of O
FIN7 B-Organization
, O
Errors.bat O
for O
EmpireMonkey B-Malware
) O
. O

Both O
used O
DocuSign O
decoy O
documents O
with O
different O
macros O
. O

The O
macros O
popped O
the O
same O
“ O
Document O
decryption O
error O
” O
error O
message—even O
if O
macro O
code O
remain O
totally O
different O
. O

We O
have O
a O
high O
level O
of O
confidence O
in O
a O
historic O
association O
between O
FIN7 B-Organization
and O
Cobalt B-Malware
, O
even O
though O
we O
believe O
that O
these O
two O
clusters O
of O
activity O
are O
operated O
by O
different O
teams O
. O

AveMaria B-Malware
is O
a O
new O
botnet O
, O
whose O
first O
version O
we O
found O
in O
September O
2018 O
, O
right O
after O
the O
arrests O
of O
the O
FIN7 B-Organization
members O
. O

We O
have O
medium O
confidence O
that O
this O
botnet O
falls O
under O
the O
FIN7 B-Organization
umbrella O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
AveMaria B-Malware
is O
a O
classic O
infostealer O
bot O
that O
collects O
all O
possible O
credentials O
from O
various O
types O
of O
software O
: O
browsers O
, O
email O
clients O
, O
messengers O
, O
etc. O


, O
and O
can O
act O
as O
a O
keylogger O
. O

Since O
the O
beginning O
of O
2019 O
, O
we O
have O
collected O
more O
than O
1300 O
samples O
and O
extracted O
more O
than O
130 O
C2s O
. O

To O
deliver O
their O
malware O
, O
the O
cyber O
criminals O
use O
spearphishing O
emails O
with O
various O
types O
of O
attachments O
: O
MS O
Office O
documents O
or O
spreadsheet O
files O
exploiting O
some O
known O
vulnerability O
like O
CVE-2017-11882 O
, O
or O
documents O
with O
Ole2Link B-Vulnerability
and O
SCT B-Vulnerability
. O

They O
also O
use O
AutoIT O
droppers O
, O
password-protected O
EXE O
files O
and O
even O
ISO O
images O
. O

What O
is O
interesting O
, O
in O
some O
emails O
, O
they O
ask O
targets O
to O
phone O
them O
if O
they O
have O
any O
questions O
, O
like O
the O
FIN7 B-Organization
guys O
do O
. O

During O
the O
investigation O
into O
FIN7 B-Organization
, O
our O
threat-hunting O
systems O
found O
an O
interesting O
overlap O
in O
between O
the O
infrastructure O
of O
FIN7 B-Organization
and O
AveMaria B-Malware
. O

Basically O
, O
two O
servers O
in O
the O
same O
IP O
range O
and O
AS14576 O
( O
autonomous O
system O
) O
share O
a O
non-standard O
SSH O
port O
, O
which O
is O
222 O
. O

One O
of O
the O
servers O
is O
a O
Griffon B-Malware
C2, O
and O
the O
other O
one O
, O
an O
AveMaria B-Malware
C2 O
. O

Distribution O
of O
targets O
is O
another O
factor O
suggesting O
that O
these O
two O
malware O
families O
may O
be O
connected O
. O

We O
analyzed O
AveMaria B-Malware
targets O
during O
February O
and O
March O
of O
2019 O
. O

The O
spearphishing O
emails O
were O
sent O
to O
various O
kinds O
of O
businesses O
only O
and O
did O
not O
target O
individuals O
. O

Thirty O
percent O
of O
the O
targets O
were O
small O
and O
medium-sized O
companies O
that O
were O
suppliers O
or O
service O
providers O
for O
bigger O
players O
and O
21% O
were O
various O
types O
of O
manufacturing O
companies O
. O

We O
also O
spotted O
several O
typical O
FIN7 B-Organization
targets O
, O
such O
as O
retailers O
and O
hotels O
. O

Most O
AveMaria B-Malware
targets O
( O
72% O
) O
were O
in O
the O
EU O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
2018 O
, O
while O
searching O
for O
new O
FIN7 B-Organization
campaigns O
via O
telemetry O
, O
we O
discovered O
a O
set O
of O
activity O
that O
we O
temporarily O
called O
“ O
CopyPaste B-Organization
” O
from O
a O
previously O
unknown O
APT O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
this O
actor O
targeted O
financial O
entities O
and O
companies O
in O
one O
African O
country O
, O
which O
lead O
us O
to O
think O
that O
CopyPaste B-Organization
was O
associated O
with O
cybermercenaries O
or O
a O
training O
center O
. O

This O
set O
of O
activity O
relied O
on O
open-source O
tools O
, O
such O
as O
Powershell O
Empire O
, O
and O
well-documented O
red O
teaming O
techniques O
, O
in O
order O
to O
get O
a O
foothold O
within O
the O
victim’s O
networks O
and O
avoid O
detection O
. O

The O
links O
between O
CopyPaste B-Organization
and O
FIN7 B-Organization
are O
still O
very O
weak O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
CopyPaste B-Organization
operators O
were O
influenced O
by O
open-source O
publications O
and O
do O
not O
have O
any O
ties O
with O
FIN7 B-Organization
. O

During O
2018 O
, O
Europol O
and O
DoJ O
announced O
the O
arrest O
of O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
FIN7 B-Organization
and O
Carbanak O
cybercrime O
groups O
. O

It O
was O
believed O
that O
the O
arrest O
of O
the O
group O
leader O
will O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
the O
group’s O
operations O
. O

However O
, O
recent O
data O
seems O
to O
indicate O
that O
the O
attacks O
have O
continued O
without O
significant O
drawbacks O
. O

One O
may O
say O
CobaltGoblin B-Organization
and O
FIN7 B-Organization
have O
even O
extended O
the O
number O
of O
groups O
operating O
under O
their O
umbrella O
. O

We O
observe O
, O
with O
various O
level O
of O
confidence O
, O
that O
there O
are O
several O
interconnected O
groups O
using O
very O
similar O
toolkits O
and O
the O
same O
infrastructure O
to O
conduct O
their O
cyberattacks O
. O

The O
first O
of O
them O
is O
the O
well-known O
FIN7 B-Organization
, O
which O
specializes O
in O
attacking O
various O
companies O
to O
get O
access O
to O
financial O
data O
or O
PoS O
infrastructure O
. O

They O
rely O
on O
a O
Griffon B-Malware
JS O
backdoor O
and O
Cobalt O
, O
and O
in O
recent O
attacks O
, O
Powershell O
Empire O
. O

The O
second O
one O
is O
CobaltGoblin O
, O
which O
uses O
the O
same O
toolkit O
, O
techniques O
and O
similar O
infrastructure O
but O
targets O
only O
financial O
institutions O
and O
associated O
software/services O
providers O
. O

We O
link O
the O
AveMaria B-Malware
botnet O
to O
these O
two O
groups O
with O
medium O
confidence O
: O
AveMaria B-Malware
’s O
targets O
are O
mostly O
suppliers O
for O
big O
companies O
, O
and O
the O
way O
AveMaria B-Malware
manages O
its O
infrastructure O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
FIN7 B-Organization
. O

The O
last O
piece O
is O
the O
newly O
discovered O
CopyPaste B-Organization
group O
, O
who O
targeted O
financial O
entities O
and O
companies O
in O
one O
African O
country O
, O
which O
lead O
us O
to O
think O
that O
CopyPaste B-Organization
was O
associated O
with O
cybermercenaries O
or O
a O
training O
center O
. O

The O
links O
between O
CopyPaste B-Organization
and O
FIN7 B-Organization
are O
still O
very O
weak O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
operators O
of O
this O
cluster O
of O
activity O
were O
influenced O
by O
open-source O
publications O
and O
do O
not O
have O
any O
ties O
with O
FIN7 B-Organization
. O

All O
of O
the O
aforementioned O
groups O
greatly O
benefit O
from O
unpatched O
systems O
in O
corporate O
environments O
. O

They O
thus O
continue O
to O
use O
effective O
spearphishing O
campaigns O
in O
conjunction O
with O
well-known O
MS O
Office O
exploits O
generated O
by O
the O
framework O
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
groups O
have O
not O
used O
any O
zero-days B-Vulnerability
. O

FIN7 O
phishing O
documents O
may O
seem O
basic O
, O
but O
when O
combined O
with O

ScarCruft B-Organization
continues O
to O
evolve, O
introduces O
Bluetooth O
harvester O
. O

After O
publishing O
our O
initial O
series O
of O
blogposts O
back O
in O
2016 O
, O
we O
have O
continued O
to O
track O
the O
ScarCruft B-Organization
threat O
actor O
. O

ScarCruft B-Organization
is O
a O
Korean-speaking O
and O
allegedly O
state-sponsored O
threat O
actor O
that O
usually O
targets O
organizations O
and O
companies O
with O
links O
to O
the O
Korean O
peninsula O
. O

We O
recently O
discovered O
some O
interesting O
telemetry O
on O
this O
actor O
, O
and O
decided O
to O
dig O
deeper O
into O
ScarCruft B-Organization
’s O
recent O
activity O
. O

This O
shows O
that O
the O
actor O
is O
still O
very O
active O
and O
constantly O
trying O
to O
elaborate O
its O
attack O
tools O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
telemetry O
, O
we O
can O
reassemble O
ScarCruft B-Organization
’s O
binary O
infection O
procedure O
. O

It O
used O
a O
multi-stage O
binary O
infection O
to O
update O
each O
module O
effectively O
and O
evade O
detection O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
victims O
of O
this O
campaign O
and O
spotted O
an O
interesting O
overlap O
of O
this O
campaign O
with O
another O
APT O
actor O
known O
as O
DarkHotel B-Organization
. O

The O
ScarCruft B-Organization
group O
uses O
common O
malware O
delivery O
techniques O
such O
as O
spear O
phishing O
and O
Strategic O
Web O
Compromises O
( O
SWC O
) O
. O

As O
in O
Operation O
Daybreak O
, O
this O
actor O
performs O
sophisticated O
attacks O
using O
a O
zero-day B-Malware
exploit O
. O

However O
, O
sometimes O
using O
public O
exploit O
code O
is O
quicker O
and O
more O
effective O
for O
malware O
authors O
. O

We O
witnessed O
this O
actor O
extensively O
testing O
a O
known O
public O
exploit O
during O
its O
preparation O
for O
the O
next O
campaign O
. O

In O
order O
to O
deploy O
an O
implant O
for O
the O
final O
payload O
, O
ScarCruft B-Organization
uses O
a O
multi-stage O
binary O
infection O
scheme O
. O

As O
a O
rule O
, O
the O
initial O
dropper O
is O
created O
by O
the O
infection O
procedure O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
notable O
functions O
of O
the O
initial O
dropper O
is O
to O
bypass O
Windows B-System
UAC O
( O
User O
Account O
Control O
) O
in O
order O
to O
execute O
the O
next O
payload O
with O
higher O
privileges O
. O

This O
malware O
uses O
the O
public O
privilege O
escalation O
exploit O
code O
CVE-2018-8120 O
or O
UACME B-Vulnerability
which O
is O
normally O
used O
by O
legitimate O
red O
teams O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
the O
installer O
malware O
creates O
a O
downloader O
and O
a O
configuration O
file O
from O
its O
resource O
and O
executes O
it O
. O

The O
downloader O
malware O
uses O
the O
configuration O
file O
and O
connects O
to O
the O
C2 O
server O
to O
fetch O
the O
next O
payload O
. O

In O
order O
to O
evade O
network O
level O
detection O
, O
the O
downloader O
uses O
steganography O
. O

The O
downloaded O
payload O
is O
an O
image O
file O
, O
but O
it O
contains O
an O
appended O
malicious O
payload O
to O
be O
decrypted O
. O

The O
final O
payload O
created O
by O
the O
aforementioned O
process O
is O
a O
well O
known O
backdoor O
, O
also O
known O
as O
ROKRAT B-Malware
by O
Cisco B-Organization
Talos I-Organization
. O

This O
cloud O
service-based O
backdoor O
contains O
many O
features O
. O

One O
of O
its O
main O
functions O
is O
to O
steal O
information O
. O

Upon O
execution O
, O
this O
malware O
creates O
10 O
random O
directory O
paths O
and O
uses O
them O
for O
a O
specially O
designated O
purpose O
. O

The O
malware O
creates O
11 O
threads O
simultaneously O
: O
six O
threads O
are O
responsible O
for O
stealing O
information O
from O
the O
infected O
host O
, O
and O
five O
threads O
are O
for O
forwarding O
collected O
data O
to O
four O
cloud O
services O
( O
Box O
, O
Dropbox O
, O
Pcloud O
and O
Yandex O
) O
. O

When O
uploading O
stolen O
data O
to O
a O
cloud O
service O
, O
it O
uses O
predefined O
directory O
path O
such O
as O
/english O
, O
/video O
or O
/scriptout O
. O

The O
ScarCruft B-Organization
group O
keeps O
expanding O
its O
Exfiltration O
targets O
to O
steal O
further O
information O
from O
infected O
hosts O
and O
continues O
to O
create O
tools O
for O
additional O
data O
Exfiltration O
. O

We O
also O
discovered O
an O
interesting O
piece O
of O
rare O
malware O
created O
by O
this O
threat O
actor O
– O
a O
Bluetooth O
device O
harvester O
. O

This O
malware O
is O
responsible O
for O
stealing O
Bluetooth O
device O
information O
. O

It O
is O
fetched O
by O
a O
downloader O
, O
and O
collects O
information O
directly O
from O
the O
infected O
host O
. O

This O
malware O
uses O
Windows B-System
Bluetooth O
APIs O
to O
find O
information O
on O
connected O
Bluetooth O
devices O
and O
saves O
the O
following O
information O
. O

We O
have O
found O
several O
victims O
of O
this O
campaign O
, O
based O
on O
our O
telemetry O
– O
investment O
and O
trading O
companies O
in O
Vietnam O
and O
Russia O
. O

We O
believe O
they O
may O
have O
some O
links O
to O
North O
Korea O
, O
which O
may O
explain O
why O
ScarCruft B-Organization
decided O
to O
closely O
monitor O
them O
. O

ScarCruft B-Organization
also O
attacked O
a O
diplomatic O
agency O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
, O
and O
another O
diplomatic O
agency O
in O
North O
Korea O
. O

It O
appears O
ScarCruft B-Organization
is O
primarily O
targeting O
intelligence O
for O
political O
and O
diplomatic O
purposes O
. O

We O
discovered O
one O
victim O
from O
Russia O
that O
also O
triggered O
a O
malware O
detection O
while O
staying O
in O
North O
Korea O
in O
the O
past O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
this O
victim O
visits O
North O
Korea O
makes O
its O
special O
and O
suggests O
that O
it O
may O
have O
valuable O
information O
about O
North O
Korean O
affairs O
. O

ScarCruft B-Organization
infected O
this O
victim O
on O
September O
21, O
2018 O
. O

But O
before O
the O
ScarCruft B-Organization
infection O
, O
however O
, O
another O
APT O
group O
also O
targeted O
this O
victim O
with O
the O
host O
being O
infected O
with O
GreezeBackdoor B-Malware
on O
March O
26, O
2018 O
. O

GreezeBackdoor B-Malware
is O
a O
tool O
of O
the O
DarkHotel B-Organization
APT O
group O
, O
which O
we O
have O
previously O
written O
about O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
this O
victim O
was O
also O
attacked O
by O
the O
Konni B-Malware
malware O
on O
03 O
April O
2018 O
. O

The O
Konni B-Malware
malware O
was O
disguised O
as O
a O
North O
Korean O
news O
item O
in O
a O
weaponized O
documents O
( O
the O
name O
of O
the O

” O
) O
This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
we O
have O
seen O
an O
overlap O
of O
ScarCruft B-Organization
and O
DarkHotel B-Organization
actors O
. O

Members O
from O
our O
team O
have O
already O
presented O
on O
the O
conflict O
of O
these O
two O
threat O
actors O
at O
security O
conferences O
. O

We O
have O
also O
shared O
more O
details O
with O
our O
threat O
intelligence O
customers O
in O
the O
past O
. O

They O
are O
both O
Korean-speaking O
threat O
actors O
and O
sometimes O
their O
victimology O
overlaps O
. O

But O
both O
group O
seem O
to O
have O
different O
TTPs O
( O
Tactics O
, O
Techniques O
and O
Procedures O
) O
and O
it O
leads O
us O
to O
believe O
that O
one O
group O
regularly O
lurks O
in O
the O
other O
’s O
shadow O
. O

The O
ScarCruft B-Organization
has O
shown O
itself O
to O
be O
a O
highly-skilled O
and O
active O
group O
. O

It O
has O
a O
keen O
interest O
in O
North O
Korean O
affairs O
, O
attacking O
those O
in O
the O
business O
sector O
who O
may O
have O
any O

In O
the O
last O
few O
days O
, O
during O
monitoring O
activities O
, O
Yoroi B-Organization
CERT I-Organization
noticed O
a O
suspicious O
attack O
against O
an O
Italian O
organization O
. O

The O
malicious O
email O
contains O
a O
highly O
suspicious O
sample O
which O
triggered O
the O

team O
to O
investigate O
its O

and O
its O
possible O

, O
discovering O
a O
potential O
expansion O
of O
the O
TA505 B-Organization

The O

is O
also O
known O
for O
its O
recent O
attack O
campaign O
against O
Bank O
and O
Retail O

sectors O
, O
but O
the O
latest O
evidence O
indicates O
a O
potential O
expansion O
of O
its O
criminal O
operation O
to O
other O
industries O
too O
. O

with O
malicious O
macro O
. O

The O
intercepted O
attack O
starts O
with O
a O
spear O
phishing O
email O
embedding O
a O
spreadsheet O
. O

The O
document O
is O
weaponized O
with O
malicious O
macro O
code O
triggered O
when O
the O
user O
opens O
the O
document O
to O
see O
the O
content O
under O
the O
obfuscated O
view O
. O

To O
understand O
its O
capabilities O
, O
the O
macro O
code O
has O
been O
isolated O
and O
analyzed O
in O
detail O
. O

Surprisingly O
, O
the O
source O
code O
is O
composed O
by O
more O
than O
1600 O
lines O
of O
code O
and O
it O
is O
highly O
obfuscated O
. O

Paying O
more O
attention O
during O
the O
code O
analysis O
, O
we O
discovered O
that O
it O
is O
full O
of O
junk O
instructions O
used O
to O
declare O
and O
initialize O
variables O
never O
used O
. O

Only O
a O
small O
portion O
of O
this O
code O
is O
actually O
used O
to O
start O
the O
infection O
, O
the O
rest O
is O
just O
junk O
code O
. O

Once O
the O
macro O
is O
executed O
, O
the O
malware O
downloads O
two O
files O
from O
“ O

, O

The O
“ O
wprgxyeqd79.exe O
” O
sample O
actually O
is O
a O
Self O
Extracting O
Archive O
( O
SFX O
) O
containing O
four O
files O
designed O
to O
be O
extracted O
in O
the O
%TEMP% O
folder O
. O

After O
that O
, O
it O
executes O
“ O
exit.exe O
” O
which O
launches O
the O
“ O
i.cmd O
” O
batch O
script O
. O

This O
new O
script O
performs O
a O
ping O
to O
“ O
www[.cloudflare[.com O
” O
for O
three O
times O
with O
a O
delay O
of O
3000ms O
, O
testing O
the O
connectivity O
of O
the O
victim O
machine O
. O

If O
the O
host O
is O
successfully O
reached O
, O
the O
script O
renames O
a O
file O
named O
“ O
kernel.dll O
” O
, O
obviously O
not O
the O
real O
one O
, O
in O
“ O
uninstall.exe O
” O
, O
another O
misleading O
name O
. O

Then O
it O
invokes O
the O
renamed O
executable O
and O
runs O
it O
passing O
a O
series O
of O
parameter O
: O
“ O
uninstall.exe O
x O
-pQELRatcwbU2EJ5 O
-y O
” O
parameters O
are O
needed O
to O
self-decrypt O
the O
“ O
uninstall.exe O
” O
file O
which O
is O
again O
another O
SFX O
archive O
. O

The O
“ O
-p O
” O
parameter O
, O
indeed O
, O
specify O
the O
password O
of O
the O
archive O
to O
be O
extracted O
. O

The O
crucial O
file O
, O
at O
this O
point O
of O
the O
infection O
, O
is O
the O
SFX O
executable O
named O
“ O
uninstall.exe O
” O
. O

It O
has O
a O
structure O
similar O
to O
previous O
“ O
wprgxyeqd79.exe O
” O
file O
: O
two O
of O
their O
files O
have O
the O
same O
name O
, O
but O
the O
content O
of O
this O
new O
SFX O
is O
extracted O
in O
the O
“ O
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Windows B-System
Anytime O
Upgrade O
” O
directory O
. O

Another O
time O
, O
the O
execution O
flow O
moves O
from O
“ O
exit.exe O
to O
“ O
i.cmd O
” O
. O

The O
script O
is O
quite O
different O
from O
the O
previous O
one O
: O
it O
guarantees O
its O
persistence O
on O
the O
victim O
machine O
through O
the O
setting O
of O
“ O
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run O
” O
registry O
key O
, O
creating O
a O
new O
entry O
named O
“ O

” O
which O
points O
to O
“ O
winserv.exe O
” O
, O
just O
stored O
into O
the O
same O
folder O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
script O
provides O
to O
run O
“ O
winserv.exe O
” O
. O

An O
interesting O
part O
of O
the O
script O
is O
the O
continuous O
killing O
of O
every O
“ O
rundll32.exe O
” O
process O
running O
into O
the O
victim O
machine O
, O
generates O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
noise O
, O
as O
visible O
in O
the O
following O
process O
explorer O
view O
. O

Anyway O
, O
just O
before O
the O
kill O
loop O
, O
the O
real O
malicious O
payload O
is O
executed O
: O
the O

After O
the O

we O
noticed O
strong O
similarities O
with O
a O
recent O
spear-phishing O

campaign O
against O
an O

. O

The O
attack O
, O
as O
stated O
by O

, O
leveraged O
a O

located O
in O

: O
a O
very O

, O
threatening O
a O
wide O
range O

, O
active O
since O
2014 O
. O

The O
comparison O
of O
the O
infection O
chains O
reveals O
in O
both O
cases O
the O
attacker O
used O
a O
couple O
of O
SFX O
stages O
to O
deploy O
the O
“ O

software O
: O
a O
legitimate O
remote O

tool O
produced O
by O
the O
Russian O

grant O

of O
the O

Also O
, O
some O

such O
as O
the O
“ O

at O

the O
“ O

and O
the O
“ O

During O
the O

, O
we O
also O
noticed O
the O
“ O

slightly O
changed O
run O
after O
run O
, O
a O
few O
hours O
after O
the O
initial O

dropped O

This O
may O
indicate O
the O

one O
of O
the O
most O

of O
the O
“ O

The O
peculiarity O
of O
this O

not O
strictly O
in O

Use O

is O
thoroughly O
documented O
in O
the O
Novetta B-Organization
and O

While O
the O
outbound O
communication O
mechanisms O
are O
well O
documented O
, O
less O
attention O
has O
been O
paid O
to O
a O
feature O
of O
recent O
versions O
of O
Winnti B-Malware
we O
came O
across O
in O
the O
Linux B-System
variant O
( O
as O
well O
as O
Windows B-System
) O
that O
allows O
the O
operators O
to O
initiate O
a O
connection O
directly O
to O
an O
infected O
host O
, O
without O
requiring O
a O
connection O
to O
a O
control O
server O
. O

This O
secondary O
communication O
channel O
may O
be O
used O
by O
operators O
when O
access O
to O
the O
hard-coded O
control O
servers O
is O
disrupted O
. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
operators O
could O
leverage O
this O
feature O
when O
infecting O
internet-facing O
devices O
in O
a O
targeted O
organization O
to O
allow O
them O
to O
reenter O
a O
network O
if O
evicted O
from O
internal O
hosts O
. O

This O
passive O
implant O
approach O
to O
network O
persistence O
has O
been O
previously O
observed O
with O
threat O
actors O
like O
Project O
Sauron O
and O
the O
Lamberts O
. O

Initial O
technical O
information O
about O
this O
feature O
was O
shared O
by O
the O
Thyssenkrupp O
CERT O
in O
the O
form O
of O
an O
Nmap O
script O
that O
could O
be O
used O
to O
identify O
Winnti B-Malware
infections O
through O
network O
scanning O
. O

This O
script O
identifies O
infected O
hosts O
by O
first O
sending O
a O
custom O
hello O
packet O
, O
immediately O
followed O
by O
an O
encoded O
request O
for O
host O
information O
, O
and O
then O
parsing O
the O
response O
. O

The O
initial O
request O
, O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
helo/hello O
request O
in O
the O
Nmap O
script O
, O
is O
comprised O
of O
four O
DWORDs O
. O

The O
first O
three O
are O
generated O
by O
rand() O
and O
the O
fourth O
is O
computed O
based O
on O
the O
first O
and O
third O
. O

When O
received O
by O
a O
Winnti B-Malware
infected O
host O
, O
it O
will O
validate O
the O
received O
packet O
and O
listen O
for O
a O
second O
inbound O
request O
containing O
tasking O
. O

This O
second O
request O
( O
Encoded O
Get O
System O
Information O
Request O
) O
is O
encoded O
using O
the O
same O
method O
as O
the O
custom O
TCP O
protocol O
used O
for O
communication O
with O
command-and-control O
servers O
, O
which O
uses O
a O
four-byte O
XOR O
encoding O
. O

Before O
acting O
on O
the O
request O
, O
Winnti B-Malware
will O
validate O
the O
third O
DWORD O
contains O
the O
magic O
value O

The O

created O

the O

soon O
after O

, O
it O
may O
be O
difficult O
to O
find O

The O

conclusion O
based O
on O

is O
that O

most O
likely O

that O

either O

that O

, O
three O

Eastern O

the O

We O
identified O
three O
themes O
in O

registered O
domains O

which O
together O
are O

relevant O

Georgian O
military O

issues O
, O

with O

are O
either O
Russian O

The O

are O
a O

to O

. O

The O
Dukes B-Organization
are O
known O
to O
employ O
a O
vast O
arsenal O
of O
malware O
toolsets O
, O
which O
we O
identify O
as O
MiniDuke B-Malware
, O
CosmicDuke B-Malware
, O
OnionDuke B-Malware
, O
CozyDuke B-Malware
, O
CloudDuke B-Malware
, O
SeaDuke B-Malware
, O
HammerDuke B-Malware
, O
PinchDuke B-Malware
, O
and O
GeminiDuke B-Malware
. O

The O
origins O
of O
the O
Duke O
toolset O
names O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
when O
researchers O
at O
Kaspersky B-Organization
Labs I-Organization
coined O
the O
term O
" O
MiniDuke B-Malware
" O
to O
identify O
the O
first O
Duke-related B-Malware
malware B-Malware
they O
found O
. O

As O
researchers O
continued O
discovering O
new O
toolsets O
that O
were O
created O
and O
used O
by O
the O
same O
group O
that O
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke B-Malware
, O
and O
thus O
the O
threat O
actor O
operating O
the O
toolsets O
started O
to O
be O
commonly O
referred O
to O
as O
" O
Dukes B-Organization
" O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
campaign O
identifiers O
found O
in O
PinchDuke B-Malware
samples I-Malware
discovered O
from O
2009 O
, O
the O
targets O
of O
the O
Dukes B-Organization
group I-Organization
during O
that O
year O
included O
organizations O
such O
as O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Defense O
of O
Georgia O
and O
the O
ministries O
of O
foreign O
affairs O
of O
Turkey O
and O
Uganda O
. O

Importantly O
, O
PinchDuke B-Malware
trojan I-Malware
samples I-Malware
alACTs O
contain O
a O
notable O
text O
string O
, O
which O
we O
believe O
is O
used O
as O
a O
campaign O
identifier O
by O
the O
Dukes B-Organization
group I-Organization
to O
distinguish O
between O
multiple O
attack O
campaigns O
that O
are O
run O
in O
parallel O
. O

This O
neatly O
ties O
together O
many O
of O
the O
tools O
used O
by O
the O
Dukes B-Organization
group I-Organization
, O
as O
versions O
of O
this O
one O
loader O
have O
been O
used O
to O
load O
malware O
from O
three O
different O
Dukes-related O
toolsets O
CosmicDuke B-Malware
, O
PinchDuke B-Malware
, O
and O
MiniDuke B-Malware
– O
over O
the O
course O
of O
five O
years O
. O

The O
Dukes B-Organization
continued O
the O
expansion O
of O
their O
arsenal O
in O
2011 O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
two O
more O
toolsets O
: O
MiniDuke B-Malware
and O
CozyDuke B-Malware
. O

As O
we O
now O
know O
, O
by O
February O
2013 O
the O
Dukes B-Organization
group I-Organization
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke B-Malware
and O
other O
toolsets O
for O
at O
least O
4 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
value O
the O
Dukes B-Organization
intended O
to O
gain O
from O
these O
MiniDuke O
campaigns O
may O
have O
been O
so O
great O
that O
they O
deemed O
it O
worth O
the O
risk O
of O
getting O
noticed O
. O

This O
is O
in O
stark O
contrast O
to O
some O
other O
suspected O
Russian O
threat O
actors B-Organization
( O
such O
as O
Operation O
Pawn O
Storm O
) O
who O
appear O
to O
have O
increased O
their O
targeting O
of O
Ukraine O
following O
the O
crisis O
. O

The O
Dukes B-Organization
actively O
targeted O
Ukraine O
before O
the O
crisis O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Russia O
was O
still O
weighing O
her O
options O
, O
but O
once O
Russia O
moved O
from O
diplomacy O
to O
direct O
action O
, O
Ukraine O
was O
no O
longer O
relevant O
to O
the O
Dukes B-Organization
in O
the O
same O
ACT O
. O

In O
the O
latter O
case O
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-Organization
group I-Organization
appear O
to O
have O
also O
simultaneously O
developed O
an O
entirely O
new O
loader O
, O
which O
we O
first O
observed O
being O
used O
in O
conjunction O
with O
CosmicDuke B-Malware
during O
the O
spring O
of O
2015 O
. O

The O
Dukes B-Organization
could O
have O
ceased O
all O
use O
of O
CosmicDuke B-Malware
( O
at O
least O
until O
they O
had O
developed O
a O
new O
loader O
) O
or O
retired O
it O
entirely O
, O
since O
they O
still O
had O
other O
toolsets O
available O
. O

For O
these O
CozyDuke O
campaigns O
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-Organization
appear O
to O
have O
employed O
two O
particular O
later-stage O
toolsets O
, O
SeaDuke B-Malware
and O
HammerDuke B-Malware
. O

Firstly O
, O
as O
with O
the O
MiniDuke O
campaigns O
of O
February O
2013 O
and O
CosmicDuke O
campaigns O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2014 O
, O
again O
the O
group O
clearly O
prioritized O
the O
continuation O
of O
their O
operations O
over O
maintaining O
stealth O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
notably O
overt O
and O
large-scale O
campaigns O
with O
CozyDuke O
and O
CloudDuke O
, O
the O
Dukes B-Organization
also O
continued O
to O
engage O
in O
more O
covert O
, O
surgical O
campaigns O
using O
CosmicDuke B-Malware
. O

We O
are O
however O
only O
aware O
of O
one O
instance O
- O
the O
exploitation O
of O
CVE-2013-0640 O
to O
deploy O
MiniDuke B-Malware
- O
where O
we O
believe O
the O
exploited O
vulnerability O
was O
a O
zero-day B-Vulnerability
at O
the O
time O
that O
the O
group O
acquired O
the O
exploit B-Vulnerability
. O

All O
of O
the O
available O
evidence O
however O
does O
in O
our O
opinion O
suggest O
that O
the O
group O
operates O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
Russian O
Federation O
. O

This O
assertion O
of O
time O
zone O
is O
also O
supported O
by O
timestamps O
found O
in O
many O
GeminiDuke B-Malware
samples I-Malware
, O
which O
similarly O
suggest O
the O
group O
work O
in O

In O
the O

as O
a O
secondary O
backdoor O
for O

if O
they O
lost O
access O

APT38 B-Organization
is O
believed O
to O
operate O
more O
similarly O
to O
an O

operation O
, O
carefully O
conducting O

within O

financial O

balancing O

objectives O

13 O
different O

APT38 B-Organization
shares O
malware O
code O

other O
development O
resources O
with O
TEMP.Hermit B-Organization
North O
Korean O
cyber O
espionage O
activity O
, O
although O
we O
consider O
APT38 B-Organization

We O
consider O
APT38 B-Organization
's O
operations O
more O
global O
and O
highly O
specialized O
for O
targeting O
the O
financial O
sector O
. O

APT38 B-Organization
is O
a O
financially O
motivated O
group O
linked O
to O
North O
Korean O
cyber B-Organization
espionage I-Organization
operators I-Organization
, O
renown O
for O
attempting O
to O
steal O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
dollars O
from O
financial O
institutions O
and O
their O
brazen O
use O
of O
destructive O
malware O
. O

Because O
APT38 B-Organization
is O
backed O
by O
( O
and O
acts O
on O

of O
) O
the O
North O
Korean O
regime O
, O
we O
opted O
to O
categorize O
the O
group O
as O
an O
" O
APT O
" O
instead O
of O
a O
" O
FIN O
" O
. O

Over O
time O
these O
malware O
similarities O
diverged O
, O
as O
did O
targeting O
, O
intended O
outcomes O
, O
and O
TTPs O
, O
almost O
certainly O
indicating O
that O
TEMP.Hermit O
activity O
is O
made O
up O
of O
multiple O
operational B-Organization
groups I-Organization
primarily O
linked O
together O
with O
shared O
malware O
development O
resources O
and O
North O
Korean O
state O
sponsorship O
. O

Based O
on O
observed O
activity O
, O
we O
judge O
that O
APT38 B-Organization
's O
primary O
mission O
is O
targeting O
financial O
institutions O
and O
manipulating O
inter-bank O
financial O
systems O
to O
raise O
large O
sums O
of O
money O
for O
the O
North O
Korean O
regime O
. O

Since O
2015 O
, O
APT38 B-Organization
has O
attempted O
to O
steal O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
dollars O
from O
financial O
institutions O
. O

APT38 B-Organization
has O
pursued O
their O
main O
objective O
of O
targeting O
banks O
and O
financial O
entities O
since O
at O
least O
2014 O
. O

We O
surmise O
that O
the O
targeting O
of O
banks O
, O
media O
, O
and O
government O
agencies O
is O
conducted O
in O
support O
of O
APT38 B-Organization
's O
primary O
mission O
. O

The O
APT38 B-Organization
targeted O
news O
outlets O
known O
for O
their O
business O
and O
financial O
sector O
reporting O
, O
probably O
in O
support O
of O
efforts O
to O
identify O
and O
compromise O
additional O
financial O
institutions O
. O

APT38 B-Organization
also O
targeted O
financial O
transaction O
exchange O
companies O
likely O
because O
of O
their O
proximity O
to O
banks O
. O

Given O
the O
lapse O
in O
time O
between O
the O
spear-phishing O
and O
the O
heist O
activity O
in O
the O
above O
example O
, O
we O
suggest O
two O
separate O
but O
related O
groups B-Organization
under O
the O
North O
Korean O
regime O
were O
responsible O
for O
carrying O
out O
missions O
; O
one O
associated O
with O
reconnaissance O
( O
TEMP.Hermit B-Organization
or O
a O
related O
group O
) O
and O
another O
for O
the O
heists O
( O
APT38 B-Organization
) O
. O

APT38 B-Organization
, O
in O
particular O
, O
is O
strongly O
distinguishable O
because O
of O
its O
specific O
focus O
on O
financial O
institutions O
and O
operations O
that O
attempt O
to O
use O
SWIFT B-Malware
fraud O
to O
steal O
millions O
of O
dollars O
at O
a O
time O
. O

We O
can O
confirm O
that O
the O
APT38 O
operator O
activity O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
North O
Korean O
regime O
, O
but O
maintains O
a O
set O
of O
common O
characteristics O
, O
including O
motivation O
, O
malware O
, O
targeting O
, O
and O
TTPs O
that O
set O
it O
apart O
from O
other O
statesponsored O
operations O
. O

As O
previously O
mentioned O
, O
we O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
APT38 B-Organization
's O
mission O
is O
focused O
on O
targeting O
financial O
institutions O
to O
raise O
money O
for O
the O

Since O
at O

the O

, O
APT38 B-Organization
operations O
have O
focused O
almost O
exclusively O
on O
developing O

While O

may O
have O
been O
driven O
by O
diplomatic O

the O
application O

to O
the O
formation O
of O

APT38 B-Organization

operations O
began O
in O
February O
2014 O

were O
likely O
influenced O
by O
financial O
sanctions O
enacted O
in O
March O
2013 O

In O
all O
, O
Kaspersky B-Organization
Lab I-Organization
discovered O
Metel B-Organization
in O
more O
than O
30 O
financial O
institutions O
. O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
this O
threat O
is O
far O
more O
widespread O
and O
we O
urge O
financial O
institutions O
around O
the O
world O
to O
scan O
their O
networks O
for O
signs O
of O
the O
Metel B-Malware
malware B-Malware
. O

A O
second O
group O
, O
which O
we O
call O
GCMAN B-Organization
because O
the O
malware O
is O
based O
on O
code O
compiled O
on O
the O
GCC O
compiler O
, O
emerged O
recently O
using O
similar O
techniques O
to O
the O
Metel B-Organization
Group I-Organization
to O
infect O
banking O
institutions O
and O
attempt O
to O
transfer O
money O
to O
e-currency O
services O
. O

Our O
investigations O
revealed O
that O
the O
attackers B-Organization
drove O
around O
several O
cities O
in O
Russia O
, O
stealing O
money O
from O
ATMs O
belonging O
to O
different O

. O

Once O
inside O

, O
the O
GCMAN B-Organization

such O
as O
Putty B-Malware
, O
VNC B-Malware
, O
and O
Meterpreter B-Malware
for O
lateral O

. O

Our O
investigation O
revealed O
an O
attack O
where O
the O
GCMAN B-Organization
group I-Organization
then O
planted O
a O
cron O
script O
into O
bank O
's O
server O
, O
sending O
financial O
transactions O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
$200 O
per O
minute O
. O

The O
GCMAN B-Organization
group I-Organization
used O
an O
MS O
SQL O
injection O
in O
commercial O
software O
running O
on O
one O
of O
bank O
's O
public O
web O
services O
, O
and O
about O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
later O
, O
they O
came O
back O

out O
. O

During O
that O
time O
they O
poked O
70 O

However O
, O
in O

published O
a O

in O
Russia O
that O
were O

. O

In O
one O
remarkable O
case O
, O
the O

Our O

shows O
that O
the O
cybercriminals B-Organization
behind O
the O

an O

in O
Central O

, O
and O
several O
other O

in O
late-2017 O
, O
were O
most O
likely O
the O
infamous O
Lazarus B-Organization
hacking I-Organization
group I-Organization
. O

The O
Lazarus B-Organization
Group I-Organization
was O
first O
identified O
in O
Novetta B-Organization
's O

Operation O

in O
February O
2016 O
. O

cyberattacks O
against O
high-value O
targets O
in O
Ukraine O
in O
December O
2015 O
and O
December O
2016 O
. O

In O
all O
of O
these O
incidents O
, O
the O
Lazarus B-Organization
utilized O
similar O
toolsets O
, O
including O
KillDisk B-Malware
that O
was O
executed O
on O
compromised O
machines O
. O

We O
are O
confident O
this O
KillDisk B-Malware
malware B-Malware
was O
deployed O
by O
Lazarus B-Organization
, O
rather O
than O
by O
another O
, O
unrelated O
attacker B-Organization
. O

This O
recent O
attack O
against O
an O
online O
casino O
in O
Central O
America O
suggests O
that O
hacking O
tools O
from O
the O
Lazarus B-Organization
toolset O
are O
recompiled O
with O
every O
attack O
( O
we O
didn't O
see O
these O
exact O
samples O
anywhere O
else O
) O
. O

Utilizing O
KillDisk B-Malware
in O
the O
attack O
scenario O
most O
likely O
served O
one O
of O
two O
purposes O
: O
the O
attackers B-Organization
covering O
their O
tracks O
after O
an O
espionage O
operation O
, O
or O
it O
was O
used O
directly O
for O
extortion O
or O
cyber-sabotage B-Organization
. O

Today O
we'd O
like O
to O
share O
some O
of O
our O
findings O
, O
and O
add O
something O
new O
to O
what O
's O
currently O
common O
knowledge O
about O
Lazarus O
Group O
activities O
, O
and O
their O
connection O
to O
the O
much O
talked O
about O
February O
2016 O
incident O
, O
when O
an O
unknown O
attacker B-Organization
attempted O
to O
steal O
up O
to O
$851M O
USD O
from O
Bangladesh O
Central O
Bank O
. O

Since O
the O
Bangladesh O
incident O
there O
have O
been O
just O
a O
few O
articles O
explaining O
the O
connection O
between O
Lazarus B-Organization
Group I-Organization
and O
the O
Bangladesh O
bank O
heist O
. O

However O
, O
from O
this O
it O
's O
only O
clear O
that O
Lazarus B-Organization
might O
have O
attacked O
Polish O
banks O
. O

Symantec B-Organization
also O
confirmed O
seeing O
the O
Lazarus B-Organization
wiper O
tool O
in O
Poland O
at O
one O
of O
their O
customers O
. O

Considering O
that O
the O
afterhack O
publications O
by O
the O
media O
mentioned O
that O
the O
investigation O
stumbled O
upon O
three O
different O
attackers B-Organization
, O
it O
was O
not O
obvious O
whether O
Lazarus B-Organization
was O
the O
one O
responsible O
for O
the O
fraudulent O
SWIFT O
transactions O
, O
or O
if O
Lazarus B-Organization
had O
in O
fact O
developed O
its O
own O
malware O
to O
attack O
banks O
' O
systems O
. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
add O
some O
strong O
facts O
that O
link O
some O
attacks O
on O
banks O
to O
Lazarus B-Organization
, O
and O
share O
some O
of O
our O
own O
findings O
as O
well O
as O
shed O
some O
light O
on O
the O
recent O
TTPs O
used O
by O
the O
attacker B-Organization
, O
including O
some O
yet O
unpublished O
details O
from O
the O
attack O
in O
Europe O
in O
2017 O
. O

Lazarus O
attacks O
are O
not O
a O
local O
problem O
and O
clearly O
the O
group O
's O
operations O
span O
across O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

Lazarus B-Organization
was O
previously O
known O
to O
conduct O
cyberespionage O
and O
cybersabotage O
activities O
, O
such O
as O
attacks O
on O
Sony O
Pictures O
Entertainment O
with O
volumes O
of O
internal O
data O
leaked O
, O
and O
many O
system O
harddrives O
in O
the O
company O
wiped O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-Organization
Group I-Organization
is O
very O
large O
and O
works O
mainly O
on O
infiltration O
and O
espionage O
operations O
, O
while O
a O
substantially O
smaller O
units O
within O
the O
group O
, O
which O
we O
have O
dubbed O
Bluenoroff B-Organization
, O
is O
responsible O
for O
financial O
profit O
. O

Lazarus B-Organization
regrouped O
and O
rushed O
into O
new O
countries O
, O
selecting O
mostly O
poorer O
and O
less O
developed O
locations O
, O
hitting O
smaller O
banks O
because O
they O
are O
, O
apparently O
, O
easy O
prey O
. O

To O
date O
, O
the O
Lazarus B-Organization
group I-Organization
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
most O
successful O
in O
launching O
large O
scale O
operations O
against O
the O
financial O
industry O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-Organization
will O
remain O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
threats O
to O
the O
banking O
sector O
, O
finance O
, O
and O
trading O
companies O
, O
as O
well O
as O
casinos O
for O
the O
next O
few O
years O
. O

We O
believe O
Lazarus B-Organization
started O
this O
watering O
hole O
attack O
at O
the O
end O
of O
2016 O
after O
their O
other O
operation O
was O
interrupted O
in O
South O
East O
Asia O
. O

We O
believe O
they O
started O
this O

at O

other O
operation O

A O
rudimentary O
but O
somewhat O
clever O
design O
, O
KiloAlfa B-Malware
provides O
keylogging O
capability O
for O
the O
Lazarus B-Organization
Group I-Organization
's O
collection O
of O
malicious O
tools O
. O

The O
design O
of O
KiloAlfa B-Malware
is O
broken O
down O
into O
two O
basic O
components O
: O
the O
persistence O
functionality O
and O
the O
keylogging B-Malware
functionality I-Malware
. O

The O
persistence O
functionality O
of O
KiloAlfa B-Malware
allows O
the O
malware O
to O
self-install O
on O
a O
victim O
's O
machine O
when O
activated O
( O
described O
below O
) O
. O

Evidence O
suggest O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-Organization
Group I-Organization
uses O
compromised B-Malware
infrastructure I-Malware
as O
the O
public-facing O
touchpoint O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
their O
malware O
samples O
. O

PapaAlfa B-Malware
is O
believed O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
proxy O
malware O
components O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-Organization
Group I-Organization
uses O
to O
hide O
the O
true O
command O
and O
control O
server O
for O
operations O
. O

Rather O
, O
PapaAlfa B-Malware
could O
be O
considered O
a O
smart O
proxy O
due O
in O
part O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-Organization
can O
easily O
switch O
the O
backend O
destination O
address O
and O
PROT O
without O
having O
to O
reestablish O
control O
over O
the O
infected O
machine O
hosting O
the O
PapaAlfa B-Malware
malware B-Malware
. O

In O
terms O
of O
form O
factor O
, O
PapaAlfa B-Malware
comes O
in O
two O
flavors O
: O
service B-Malware
DLL I-Malware
and O
standalone B-Malware
executable I-Malware
. O

The O
IndiaBravo-PapaAlfa B-Malware
installer I-Malware
is O
responsible O
for O
installing O
the O

. O

While O
the O
tools O
profiled O
in O
this O
report O
are O
not O
inherently O
malicious O
, O
their O
capabilities O
are O
nonetheless O
integral O
to O
the O
Lazarus B-Organization
Group I-Organization
's O
cyber O
operations O
, O
both O
espionage O
and O
destructive O
in O
nature O
, O
making O
them O
inherently O
dangerous O
to O
potential O
victims O
. O

These O
tools O
often O
lay O
the O
groundwork O
for O
further O
malicious O
activity O
, O
such O
as O
the O
targeting O
of O
antivirus O
capabilities O
and O
the O
disabling O
of O

, O
both O
of O
which O
are O

that O
we O
believe O
has O
been O
in O
use O
for O
over O
3 O
years O
. O

During O
this O
time O
it O
has O

, O
keystrokes O
, O
perform O

, O
and O
execute O
arbitrary O
code O
on O

named O
this O
malware O
KONNI B-Malware
. O

Throughout O
the O
multiple O
campaigns O
observed O
over O
the O
last O
3 O
years O
, O
the O
actor O
has O
used O
an O
email O
attachment O
as O
the O
initial O
infection O
vector O
. O

They O
then O
use O
additional O
social O
engineering O
to O
prompt O
the O
target O
to O
open O
a O
.scr O
file O
, O
display O
a O
decoy O
document O
to O
the O
users O
, O
and O
finally O
execute O
the O
malware O
on O
the O
victim's O
machine O
. O

The O
malware O
infrastructure O
of O
the O
analysed O
samples O
was O
hosted O
by O
a O
free O
web O

. O

The O
malware O
has O
evolved O
over O
time O
. O

In O
this O
article O
, O
we O
will O
analyse O
this O
evolution: O
at O
the O
beginning O
the O
malware O
was O
only O
an O
information O
stealer O
without O
remote O
administration O
, O
it O
moved O
from O
a O
single O
file O
malware O
to O
a O
dual O
file O
malware O
(an O
executable O
and O
a O
dynamic O
library O
) O
, O
the O
malware O
has O
supported O
more O
and O
more O
features O
over O
the O
time O
, O
the O
decoy O
documents O
have O
become O
more O
and O
more O
advanced O
. O

The O
different O
versions O
contain O
copy/pasted O
code O
from O
previous O
versions O
. O

Moreover O
the O
new O
version O
searches O
for O
files O
generated O
by O
previous O
versions O
. O

This O
evolution O
is O
illustrated O
across O
4 O
campaigns O
: O
one O
in O
2014 O
, O
one O
in O
2016 O
and O
finally O
two O
in O
2017 O
. O

The O
decoy O
document O
of O
the O
2 O
last O
campaigns O
suggests O
that O
the O
targets O
are O
public O
organisations O
. O

Both O
documents O
contained O
email O
addresses O
, O
phone O
numbers O
and O
contacts O
of O
members O
of O
official O
organizations O
such O
as O
United O
Nations O
, O
UNICEF O
, O
and O
Embassies O
linked O
to O
North O
Korea O
. O

In O
this O
campaign O
, O
the O
dropper O
filename O
was O
beauty.scr O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
compilation O
date O
of O
the O
two O
binaries O
, O
this O
campaign O
took O
place O
in O
September O
2014 O
. O

Once O
executed O
, O
two O
files O
were O
dropped O
on O
the O
targeted O
system O
: O
a O
decoy O
document O
(a O
picture) O
and O
a O
fake O
svchost.exe O
binary O
. O

Both O
files O
were O
stored O
in O
"C:\Windows" O
. O

The O
fake O
svchost O
binary O
is O
the O
KONNI B-Malware
malware O
. O

The O
first O
task O
of O
the O
malware O
is O
to O
generate O
an O
ID O
to O
identify O
the O
infected O
system O
. O

This O
ID O
is O
generated O
based O
on O
the O
installation O
date O
of O
the O
system O
. O

The O
second O
task O
of O
malware O
is O
to O
ping O
the O
CC O
and O
get O
orders O
. O

The O
malware O
includes O
2 O
domains: O
phpschboy.prohosts.org O
, O
jams481.site.bz O
. O

The O
developer O
used O
the O
Microsoft O
Winsocks O
API O
to O
handle O
the O
network O
connection O
. O

Surprisingly O
, O
this O
isn't O
the O
easiest O
or O
the O
most O
efficient O
technical O
choice O
for O
HTTP O
connection O
. O

The O
malware O
samples O
we O
analysed O
connected O
to O
only O
one O
URI: O
<c2-domain>/login.php O
. O

This O
version O
of O
KONNI B-Malware
is O
not O
designed O
to O
execute O
code O
on O
the O
infected O
system O
. O

The O
purpose O
is O
to O
be O
executed O
only O
once O
and O
steal O
data O
on O
the O
infected O
system O
, O
here O
are O
the O

The O
name O
of O
the O

was O
directly O
linked O
to O
tension O
between O
North O
Korea O
and O
USA O
in O
March O
2016 O
more O
information O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
compilation O
dates O
of O
the O
binaries O
, O
the O
campaign O
took O
place O
in O
the O
same O
period O
. O

An O
interesting O
fact O
: O
the O
dropped O
library O
was O
compiled O
in O
2014 O
and O
appears O
in O
our O
telemetry O
in O
August O
2015 O
. O

Indicating O
that O
this O
library O
was O
probably O
used O
in O
another O
campaign O
. O

The O
.scr O
file O
contains O
2 O
Office O
documents O
. O

The O
first O
document O
was O
in O
English O
and O
a O
second O
in O
Russian O
. O

In O
the O
sample O
only O
the O
English O
version O
can O
be O
displayed O
to O
the O
user O
(that O
is O
hardcoded O
in O
the O
sample) O
. O

The O
Russian O
document O
is O
not O
used O
by O
the O
sample O
, O
we O
assume O
that O
the O
author O
of O
the O
malware O
forgot O
to O
remove O
the O
resource O
containing O
the O
Russia O
decoy O
document O
. O

The O
malware O
author O
changed O
the O
malware O
architecture O
, O
this O
version O
is O
divided O
in O
two O
binaries: O
conhote.dll O
, O
winnit.exe O
. O

Another O
difference O
is O
the O
directory O
where O
the O
files O
are O
dropped O
, O
it's O
no O
longer O
C:\Windows O
but O
rather O
the O
local O
setting O
of O
the O
current O
user O
(%USERPROFILE%\Local O
Settings\winnit\winnit.exe) O
. O

Thanks O
to O
this O
modification O
, O
the O
malware O
can O
be O
executed O
with O
a O
non-administrator O
account O
. O

The O
.dll O
file O
is O
executed O
by O
the O
.exe O
file O
. O

In O
this O
version O
, O
a O
shortcut O
is O
created O
in O
order O
to O
launch O
winnit.exe O
in O
the O
following O
path O
%USERPROFILE%\Start O
Menu\Programs\Startup\Anti O
virus O
service.lnk O
. O

As O
you O
can O
see O
the O
attacker O
has O
went O
to O
great O
lengths O
to O
disguise O
his O
service O
as O
a O
legitimate O
Antivirus O
Service O
by O
using O
the O
name O
'Anti O
virus O
service.lnk' O
. O

This O
is O
of O
course O
simple O
but O
often O
it O
can O
be O
enough O
for O
a O
user O
to O
miss O
something O
malicious O
by O
name O
. O

As O
in O
the O
previous O
version O
, O
the O
ID O
of O
the O
infected O
system O
is O
generated O
with O
exactly O
the O
same O
method O
. O

The O
C2 O
is O
different O
and O
the O
analysed O
version O
this O
time O
only O
contains O
a O
single O
domain: O
dowhelsitjs.netau.net O
. O

In O
this O
version O
, O
the O
developer O
used O
a O
different O
API O
, O
the O
Wininet O
API O
which O
make O
more O
sense O
for O
Web O
requests O
. O

Moreover O
the O
C2 O
infrastructure O
evolved O
too O
, O
more O
.php O

are O
available O
through O
the O
web O
hosting: O
<c2-domain>/login.php O
<c2-domain>/upload.php O
<c2-domain>/download.php O
. O

This O
version O
includes O
the O
stealer O
features O
mentioned O
in O
the O
previous O
version O
and O
additionally O
Remote O
Administration O
Tool O
features O
such O
as O
file O

and O
arbitrary O

execution O
. O

The O
library O
is O
only O
used O
to O
perform O
keylogging O
and O
clipboard O
stealing O
. O

Indeed O
, O
the O
malware O
author O
moved O
this O
part O
of O
the O
code O
from O
the O
core O
of O
the O
malware O
to O
a O
library O
. O

An O
interesting O
element O
is O
that O
the O
malware O
looks O
for O
filenames O
created O
with O
the O
previous O
version O
of O
KONNI B-Malware
. O

This O
implies O
that O
the O
malware O
targeted O
the O
same O
people O
as O
the O
previous O
version O
and O
they O
are O
designed O
to O
work O
together O
. O

The O
malware O
internally O
uses O
the O
following O
files O
: O
solhelp.ocx O

screentmp.tmp O
(log O

Contrary O
to O
the O

This O

drops O
exactly O
the O
same O
files O
than O
the O
previous O
campaign O
but O
the O
decoy O

is O
different O
. O

This O

of O

The O
analysis O
shows O
us O
the O
evolution O
of O
KONNI B-Malware
over O
the O
last O
3 O
years O
. O

The O
last O
campaign O
was O
started O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
and O
is O
still O
active O
. O

The O
infrastructure O
remains O
up O
and O
running O
at O
the O
time O
of O
this O
post O
. O

The O
RAT O
has O
remained O
under O
the O
Radar O
for O
multiple O
years O
. O

An O
explanation O
could O
be O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
campaign O
was O
very O
limited O
nature O
, O
which O
does O
not O
arouse O
suspicion O
. O

This O
investigation O
shows O
that O
the O
author O
has O
evolved O
technically O
(by O
implementing O
new O
features) O
and O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
decoy O
documents O
. O

The O
campaign O
of O
April O
2017 O
used O
pertinent O
documents O
containing O
potentially O
sensitive O
data O
. O

Moreover O
the O
metadata O
of O
the O
Office O
document O
contains O
the O
names O
of O
people O
who O
seems O
to O
work O
for O
a O
public O
organization O
. O

We O
don't O
know O
if O
the O
document O
is O
a O
legitimate O
compromised O
document O
or O
a O
fake O
that O
the O
attacker O
has O
created O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
be O
credible O
. O

Clearly O
the O
author O
has O
a O
real O
interest O
in O
North O

, O
with O
3 O
of O
the O
4 O

One O
of O
the O

is O
that O
the O
amount O

significantly O
increased O
after O

Our O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
malware O
authors O
created O
Emissary B-Malware
as O
early O
as O
2009 O
, O
which O
suggests O
that O
threat O
actors B-Organization
have O
relied O
on O
this O

as O
a O

in O

attacks O
for O
many O

While O
it O

more O

it O

still O
able O
to O
carry O

first O
created O
( O

) O
in O
May O
2009 O
and O
quickly O
received O
an O
update O
that O
resulted O
in O
version O
1.1 O
in O
June O
2009 O
. O

Between O
August O
and O
November O
2015 O
the O

creates O
several O
new O

of O

, O
specifically O
5.0 O
, O
5.1 O
, O
5.3 O
and O
5.4 O
in O
a O
much O
more O
rapid O
succession O
compared O
to O
development O
process O
in O
earlier O
versions O
. O

Version O
2.0 O
received O
one O
update O
in O
October O
2013 O
before O

released O

in O

While O
this O
may O
be O

APT10 B-Organization
withdrew O
from O
direct O
targeting O
using O
Poison B-Malware
Ivy I-Malware
in O
2013 O
and O
conducted O
its O
first O
known O
retooling O
operation O
, O
upgrading O
its O
capabilities O
and O
replatforming O
to O
use O
PlugX B-Malware
. O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
this O
is O
due O
to O
the O
release O
of O
the O
2013 O
FireEye B-Organization
report O
. O

Our O
report O
will O
detail O
the O
most O
recent O
campaigns O
conducted O
by O
APT10 B-Organization
, O
including O
the O
sustained O
targeting O
of O
MSPs O
, O
which O
we O
have O
named O
Operation O
Cloud O
Hopper O
, O
and O
the O
targeting O
of O
a O
number O
of O
Japanese O
institutions O
. O

MSPs O
therefore O
represent O
a O
high-payoff O
target O
for O
espionagefocused O
threat O
actors B-Organization
such O
as O
APT10 B-Organization
. O

Given O
the O
level O
of O
client O
network O
access O
MSPs O
have O
, O
once O
APT10 B-Organization
has O
gained O
access O
to O
a O
MSP B-Malware
, O
it O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
relatively O
straightforward O
to O
exploit B-Vulnerability
this O
and O
move O
laterally O
onto O
the O
networks O
of O
potentially O
thousands O
of O
other O
victims O
. O

This O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
would O
provide O
access O
to O
a O
larger O
amount O
of O
intellectual O
property O
and O
sensitive O
data O
. O

APT10 B-Organization
has O
been O
observed O
to O
exfiltrate O
stolen O
intellectual O
property O
via O
the O
MSPs O
, O
hence O
evading O
local O
network O
defences O
. O

The O
command O
and O
control O
( O
C2 O
) O
infrastructure O
chosen O
by O
APT10 B-Organization
for O
Operation O
Cloud O
Hopper O
is O
predominantly O
referenced O
using O
dynamic-DNS B-Malware
domains I-Malware
. O

Several O
of O
these O
provide O
enterprise O
services O
or O
cloud O
hosting O
, O
supporting O
our O
assessment O
that O
APT10 B-Organization
are O
almost O
certainly O
targeting O
MSPs O
. O

The O
13th O
FYP O
was O
released O
in O
March O
2016 O
and O
the O
sectors O
and O
organisations O
known O
to O
be O
targeted O
by O
APT10 B-Organization
are O
broadly O
in O
line O
with O
the O
strategic O
aims O
documented O
in O
this O
plan O
. O


These O
aims O
outlined O
in O
the O
FYP O
will O
largely O
dictate O
the O
growth O
of O
businesses O
in O
China O
and O
are O
, O
therefore O
, O
likely O
to O
also O
form O
part O
of O
Chinese O
companies O
' O
business O
strategies O
. O

APT10 B-Organization
has O
, O
in O
the O
past O
, O
primarily O
been O
known O
for O
its O
targeting O
of O
government O
and O
US O
defence O
industrial O
base O
organisations O
, O
with O
the O
earliest O
known O
date O
of O
its O
activity O
being O
in O
December O
2009 O
. O

Observed O
APT10 B-Organization
targeting O
is O
in O
line O
with O
many O
of O
the O
historic O
compromises O
we O
have O
outlined O
previously O
as O
originating O
from O
China O
. O

In O
line O
with O
commonly O
used O
APT B-Organization
actor I-Organization
methodologies O
, O
the O
threat O
actor O
aligns O
its O
decoy B-Malware
documents I-Malware
to O
a O
topic O
of O
interest O
relevant O
to O
the O
recipient O
. O

This O
section O
details O
changes O
made O
to O
APT10 B-Organization
tools O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
post-2014 O
, O
following O
its O
shift O
from O
Poison B-Malware
Ivy I-Malware
to O
PlugX B-Malware
. O

We O
have O
observed O
that O
in O
cases O
where O
APT10 B-Organization
has O
infiltrated O
a O
target O
via O
an O
MSP B-Malware
, O
it O
continues O
to O
use O
the O
MSPs O
credentials O
. O

In O
order O
to O
gain O
any O
further O
credentials O
, O
APT10 B-Organization
will O
usually O
deploy O
credential O
theft O
tools O
such O
as O
mimikatz B-Malware
or O
PwDump B-Malware
, O
sometimes O
using O
DLL B-Malware
load I-Malware
order I-Malware
hijacking I-Malware
, O
to O
use O
against O
a O
domain O
controller O
, O
explained O
further O
in O
Annex O
B O
. O

APT10 B-Organization
achieves O
persistence O
on O
its O
targets O
primarily O
by O
using O
scheduled B-Malware
tasks I-Malware
or O
Windows B-Malware
services I-Malware
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
the O
malware O
remains O
active O
regardless O
of O
system O
reboots O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
compromising O
high O
value O
domain O
controllers O
and O
security O
servers O
, O
the O
threat O
actor O
has O
also O
been O
observed O
identifying O
and O
subsequently O
installing O
malware O
on O
low O
profile O
systems O
that O
provide O
non-critical O
support O
functions O
to O
the O
business O
, O
and O
are O
thus O
less O
likely O
to O
draw O
the O
attention O
of O
system O
administrators O
. O

In O
the O
majority O
of O
instances O
APT10 B-Organization
used O
either O
a O
reverse B-Malware
shell I-Malware
or O
RDP B-Malware
connection O
to O
install O
its O
malware O
; O
the O
actor B-Organization
also O
uses O
these O
methods O
to O
propagate O
across O
the O
network O
. O

The O
tactical O
malware O
, O
historically O
EvilGrab B-Malware
, O
and O
now O
ChChes B-Malware
( O
and O
likely O
also O
RedLeaves B-Malware
) O
, O
is O
designed O
to O
be O
lightweight O
and O
disposable O
, O
often O
being O
delivered O
through O
spear O
phishing O
. O

Once O
executed O
, O
tactical O
malware O
contains O
the O
capability O
to O
profile O
the O
network O
and O
manoeuvre O
through O
it O
to O
identify O
a O
key O
system O
of O
interest O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
APT10 B-Organization
use O
DLL O
search O
order O
hijacking O
and O
sideloading O
, O
to O
execute O
some O
modified O
versions O
of O
open-source O
tools O
. O

For O
example O
, O
PwC B-Organization
UK I-Organization
has O
observed O
APT10 B-Organization
compiling O
DLLs O
out O
of O
tools O
, O
such O
as O
Mimikatz B-Malware
and O
PwDump6 B-Malware
, O
and O
using O
legitimate O
, O
signed B-Malware
software I-Malware
, O
such O
as O
Windows B-System
Defender O
to O
load O
the O
malicious O
payloads O
. O

During O
our O
analysis O
of O
victim O
networks O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
observe O
APT10 B-Organization
once O
again O
initiate O
a O
retooling O
cycle O
in O
late O
2016 O
. O

We O
observed O
the O
deployment O
and O
testing O
of O
multiple O
versions O
of O
Quasar B-Malware
malware B-Malware
, O
and O
the O
introduction O
of O
the O
bespoke O
malware O
families O
ChChes B-Malware
and O
RedLeaves B-Malware
. O

APT10 B-Organization
is O
a O
constantly O
evolving O
, O
highly O
persistent O
China-based O
threat O
actor O
that O
has O
an O
ambitious O
and O
unprecedented O
collection O
programme O
against O
a O
broad O
spectrum O
of O
sectors O
, O
enabled O
by O
its O
strategic O
targeting O
. O

Since O
exposure O
of O
its O
operations O
in O
2013 O
, O
APT10 B-Organization
has O
made O
a O
number O
of O
significant O
changes O
intended O
to O
thwart O
detection O
of O
its O
campaigns O
. O

PwC B-Organization
UK I-Organization
and O
BAE B-Organization
Systems I-Organization
, O
working O
closely O
with O
industry O
and O

, O
have O
uncovered O
a O
new O
, O
unparallelled O
campaign O
which O
we O
refer O
to O
as O
Operation O
Cloud O
Hopper O
. O

This O
operation O
has O
targeted O
managed O
IT O
service O
providers O
, O
the O
compromise O
of O
which O
provides O
APT10 B-Organization
with O
potential O
access O
to O
thousands O
of O
further O
victims O
. O

An O
additional O
campaign O
has O
also O
been O
observed O
targeting O
Japanese O
entities O
. O

APT10 B-Organization
's O
malware O
toolbox O
shows O
a O
clear O
evolution O
from O
malware O
commonly O
associated O
with O
China-based O
threat O
actors B-Organization
towards O
bespoke O
in-house O
malware O
that O
has O
been O
used O
in O
more O
recent O
campaigns O
; O
this O
is O
indicative O
of O
APT10 B-Organization
's O
increasing O
sophistication O
, O
which O
is O
highly O
likely O
to O
continue O
. O

The O
threat O

and O
its O

corresponds O
to O
that O
of O
other O
known O
China-based O
threat O
actors B-Organization
, O
which O
supports O
our O
assessment O
that O
these O
campaigns O
are O
conducted O
by O
APT10 B-Organization
. O

APT10 B-Organization
( O
MenuPass B-Organization
Group I-Organization
) O
is O
a O
Chinese O
cyber O
espionage O
group O
that O
FireEye B-Organization
has O
tracked O
since O

Its O
targets O
include O
the O
military O

and O
governments O
of O
countries O
with O

in O
the O
South O
China O
Sea O
, O
including O
some O
within O
the O
U.S. O

However O
, O
FireEye B-Organization
researchers O
do O
not O
have O

insight O
to O
reliably O
report O
a O
definitive O
connection O
to O
the O
Moafee B-Organization
and O
DragonOK B-Organization
groups I-Organization
. O

Both O
Moafee B-Organization

DragonOK B-Organization
favor O
spear-phishing O

, O
often O
employing O

, O
Moafee B-Organization
likely O

, O
DragonOK B-Organization
may O
be O
acquiring O

that O
targeted O
not O
just O

in O
Japan O
and O

. O

In O
2012 O
, O
the O
Molerats O
attacks O
appeared O
to O
rely O
heavily O
on O
the O
XtremeRAT B-Malware

a O
freely O
available O
tool O
that O
is O
popular O
with O
attackers B-Organization
based O
in O

But O
the O
group O
has O
also O
used O
Poison B-Malware
Ivy I-Malware
( O
PIVY B-Malware
) O
, O
a O
RAT B-Malware
more O
commonly O
associated O
with O

in O
China O
— O
so O
much O
so O
that O
PIVY B-Malware
has O
, O
inaccurately O
, O
become O
synonymous O
with O
all O
APT O
attacks O
linked O
to O
China O

This O
blog O

several O
recent O
Molerats O

that O
deployed O
PIVY B-Malware
against O

in O
the O
U.S. O
We O
also O
examine O
additional O
PIVY O

that O
leverage O
Arabic-language O

in O
Egypt O
and O
the O
wider O
Middle O

We O
do O
not O
know O
whether O
using O
PIVY B-Malware
is O
an O
attempt O
by O
those O
behind O
the O
Molerats O
campaign O
to O
frame O
China-based O
threat O
actors B-Organization
for O
their O

that O
they O
have O
added O
another O

While O
researching O
the O

, O
we O
have O
seen O
two O

on O
Saudi O

in O
which O
a O
group O
of O
threat O
actors B-Organization
delivered O
the O
Helminth O
Trojan O
as O
a O
payload O
. O

The O
two O
variants O
of O
Helminth B-Malware
do O
require O
different O
delivery O
methods O
, O
with O
the O
script O
variant O
relying O
on O
an O
Excel O
spreadsheet O
for O
delivery O
, O
while O
the O
executable O
variant O
is O
more O
traditional O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
can O
be O
installed O
without O
a O

document O
. O

Since O
our O
first O
published O
analysis O
of O
the O
OilRig O

in O
May O
2016 O
, O
we O
have O
continued O
to O
monitor O
this O
group O
for O
new O

. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
scope O
of O
organizations O
targeted O
by O
this O
group O
has O
expanded O
to O
not O

also O
a O

The O

continues O
to O
leverage O
spear-phishing O

In O
addition O

were O
the O
subject O
to O
spear O

earlier O
this O
year O
. O

While O
the O

not O
terribly O
sophisticated O
, O
it O
uses O
techniques O
such O
as O
DNS O
command O

that O
allows O
it O
to O
stay O
under O

We O
assess O
this O

carried O
out O
by O
a O
suspected O
Iranian O

, O
whom O
we O

as O
APT34 B-Organization
, O
using O
a O
custom B-Malware

backdoor I-Malware
to O
achieve O
its O
objectives O

We O
assess O
that O
APT34 B-Organization
works O
on O

carry O
out O
an O
attack O
on O

APT34 B-Organization
uses O
a O

Just O
over O
a O
week O
later O
, O
on O
January O
16 O
, O
2018 O
, O
we O
observed O
an O
attack O
on O
a O
Middle O
Eastern O
financial O
institution O
. O

The O
January O
8 O
attack O
used O
a O
variant O
of O
the O
ThreeDollars O
delivery O
document O
, O
which O
we O
identified O
as O
part O
of O
the O
OilRig B-Organization
toolset O
based O
on O
attacks O
that O
occurred O
in O
August O
2017 O
. O

However O
, O
the O
attack O
on O
January O
16 O
did O
not O
involve O
ThreeDollars B-Malware
at O
all O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
targeted O
organization O
in O
the O
January O
16 O
attack O
had O
already O
been O
targeted O
by O
the O
OilRig B-Organization
group I-Organization
a O
year O
ago O
on O
January O
2017 O
. O

Instead O
, O
OilRig B-Organization
's O
attack O
involved O
delivering O
the O
OopsIE B-Malware
Trojan I-Malware
directly O
to O
the O
victim O
, O
most O
likely O
using O
a O
link O
in O
a O
spear O
phishing O
email O
. O

In O
the O
January O
16 O
, O
2018 O
attack O
, O
we O
observed O
OilRig O
attacking O
an O
organization O
it O
previously O
targeted O
in O
January O
2017 O
. O

On O
January O
8 O
, O
2018 O
, O
the O
OilRig B-Organization
threat O
group O
sent O
an O
email O
with O
the O
subject O
Beirut O
Insurance O
Seminar O
Invitation O
to O
an O
insurance O
agency O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O

The O
email O
contained O
an O
attachment O
named O
Seminar-Invitation.doc O
, O
which O
is O
a O
malicious O
Microsoft O
Word O
document O
we O
track O
as O
ThreeDollars B-Malware
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
due O
to O
the O
January O
2017 O
attack O
, O
the O
targeted O
organization O
may O
have O
taken O
actions O
to O
counter O
known O
OilRig B-Organization
TTPs O
, O
in O
this O
case O
delivering O
malicious O
macro O
documents O
, O
causing O
the O
OilRig B-Organization
operators B-Organization
to O
adopt O
a O
different O
delivery O
tactic O
. O

We O
also O
identified O
another O
sample O
of O
ThreeDollars B-Malware
, O
created O
on O
January O
15 O
, O
2017 O
with O
the O

. O

The O
samples O
of O
ThreeDollars B-Malware
we O
collected O
in O
these O
attacks O
are O
structurally O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
first O

Based O
on O
that O
research O
and O
this O
observation O
, O
we O
postulate O
that O
the O
OilRig B-Organization
group I-Organization
gathered O

to O
a O
legitimate O
user O

OWA O
account O
and O
logged O

The O
OilRig B-Organization

in O
this O

. O

The O
payload O
embedded O
within O
the O
ISMInjector B-Malware
sample I-Malware
delivered O
in O
this O

is O
a O
variant O
of O
the O

in O
our O

Initial O

of O
this O

suggested O
this O
was O
again O
the O
OilRig O
campaign O
using O
their O
existing O

, O
but O
further O
examination O
revealed O
not O
only O
new O

of O
the O

we O
named O
Clayslide B-Malware
, O
but O
also O
a O

In O
July O
2017 O
, O
we O
observed O
an O

to O
deliver O
as O
a O

a O
Trojan B-Malware
we O
named O
Helminth B-Malware
; O
in O
this O
instance O
, O
the O
payload O
was O
instead O
a O
variant O
of O
the O
ISMDoor B-Malware
Trojan I-Malware
with O
significant O
modifications O
which O
we O
are O
now O

, O
but O
instead O

Most O
of O
the O

are O
focused O
on O

While O
tracking O

Suckfly O
used O
its O

we O
discovered O
that O
the O

By O
targeting O
all O
of O
these O

together O
, O
Suckfly O
could O
have O
had O
a O
much O

may O
point O

There O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
Suckfly O
gained O
any O
benefits O
from O
attacking O

someone O

In O
December O
2017 O
, O
FireEye B-Organization
publicly O
released O
our O

to O
manipulate O
industrial O

In O
our O
most O
recent O

, O
we O
attributed O
the O

that O
led O
to O
the O
deployment O
of O

to O
a O

is O
often O
a O

due O
to O

Venomous B-Organization
Bear I-Organization
has O
deployed O

to O

using O
several O
novel O
methods O
. O

For O
years O
, O
Turla B-Organization
has O
relied O
, O
among O
other O
impersonations O
, O
on O
fake B-Malware
Flash I-Malware

to O
compromise O
victims O
. O

Turla B-Organization
merely O
uses O
the O
Adobe O

to O
trick O

into O
downloading O
the O

. O

By O
looking O
at O
our O

, O
we O
found O
evidence O
that O
Turla B-Organization

were O
exfiltrating O

Our O

2018 O
white O
paper O
was O
the O
first O
public O
analysis O
of O
a O
Turla O

called O
Mosquito O
. O

It O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Turla B-Organization
has O
used O
generic B-Malware
tools I-Malware
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
we O
have O
seen O
the O
group O
using O
open-source B-Malware
password I-Malware
dumpers I-Malware
such O
as O
Mimikatz B-Malware
. O

Starting O
in O
March O
2018 O
, O
we O
observed O
a O
significant O
change O
in O
the O
campaign O
: O
it O
now O
leverages O
the O
open O
source O
exploitation O
framework O
Metasploit B-Malware
before O
dropping O
the O
custom O
Mosquito O
backdoor O
. O

Even O
an O
experienced O
user O
can O
be O
fooled O
by O
downloading O
a O
malicious O
file O
that O
is O
apparently O
from O
adobe.com O
, O
since O
the O
URL O
and O
the O
IP O
address O
correspond O
to O
Adobe O

legitimate O
infrastructure O
. O

However O
, O
to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
Turla B-Organization
has O
used O
Metasploit B-Malware
as O
a O
first O
stage O
backdoor O
, O
instead O
of O
relying O
on O
one O
of O
its O
own O
tools O
such O
as O

was O
intercepted O
on O
a O

to O
replace O

with O
a O

2018 O
, O
as O
part O
of O
our O
regular O

we O
observed O
some O
changes O
in O
the O

. O

In O
this O

, O
we O
have O
presented O
the O
evolutions O
of O
the O
Turla O
Mosquito O

over O
the O
last O
few O
months O
. O

Primary O
targets O
for O

are O
in O
the O

, O
NGO O
, O

, O

sectors O
. O

Turla B-Organization

still O
relies O
on O
a O
fake O

but O
, O
instead O
of O
directly O
dropping O
the O
two O
malicious O

, O
it O
executes O

shellcode I-Malware
and I-Malware
drops I-Malware
, O
or O
downloads O
from O
Google O

, O
a O
legitimate O

. O

The O
Turla B-Organization
espionage O
group O
has O
been O
targeting O
various O
institutions O
for O
many O
years O
. O

Recently O
, O
we O
found O
several O
new O

The O
Turla B-Organization

is O
known O
to O
be O
painstaking O
and O
work O
in O

, O
first O
doing O

on O
their O

before O

in O
mid-February O
2017 O

Like O
previous O
Turla O

, O
WhiteBear B-Malware
leverages O
compromised O
websites O
and O
hijacked O
satellite O

for O
command O

WhiteBear B-Malware
is O
a O
parallel O
project O
or O
second O
stage O
of O

cluster O
of O

in O
another O

" O

Turla I-Malware
– O
the O
White B-Malware
Atlas I-Malware
framework O
" O
from O
mid-2016 O
. O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
similarities O
to O
previous O
Turla O
campaigns O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
WhiteBear B-Malware
is O
a O
distinct O
project O
with O
a O
separate O
focus O
. O

From O
February O
to O
September O
2016 O
, O
WhiteBear O
activity O
was O
narrowly O
focused O
on O
embassies O
and O
consular O
operations O
around O
the O
world O
. O

Continued O
WhiteBear O
activity O
later O
shifted O
to O
include O
defense-related O
organizations O
into O
June O
2017 O
. O

All O
of O
these O
early O
WhiteBear B-Malware
targets O
were O
related O
to O
embassies O
and O
diplomatic/foreign O
affair O
organizations O
. O

Thus O
, O
Turla B-Organization
operators O
had O
access O
to O
some O
highly O
sensitive O
information O
( O
such O
as O
emails O
sent O
by O
the O
German O
Foreign O
Office O
staff O
) O
for O
almost O
a O
year O
. O

Our O
investigation O
also O
led O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
dozens O
of O
email O
addresses O
registered O
by O
Turla B-Organization
operators O
for O
this O
campaign O
and O
used O
to O
receive O
exfiltrated O
data O
from O
the O
victims O
. O

It O
mainly O
targets O
Microsoft O
Outlook O
, O
a O
widely O
used O
mail O
client O
, O
but O
also O
targets O
The O
Bat! O
, O
a O

client O
very O
popular O
in O
Eastern O
Europe O
. O

First O
, O
Turla B-Organization
steals O
emails O
by O
forwarding O
all O
outgoing O

to O
the O
attackers O
. O

We O
identified O
several O
European O
governments O
and O
defense O
companies O
compromised O
with O
this O
group O
. O

What O
actually O
happens O
is O
that O
the O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
decode O
data O
from O
the O
PDF B-Malware
documents I-Malware
and O
interpret O
it O
as O

In O
early O

, O
multiple O

claimed O
that O
Turla B-Organization
operators O
used O

to O
control O
infected O

. O

As O
detailed O
in O
the O
previous O
section O
, O
this O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
manipulate O
and O
exfiltrate O
emails O
. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
Turla B-Organization
is O
the O
only O
espionage O
group O
that O
currently O
uses O
a O
backdoor O
entirely O
controlled O
by O
emails O
, O
and O
more O
specifically O
via O
PDF B-Malware

. O

The O

Our O
research O
shows O
that O
compromised O
organizations O
are O
at O
risk O
of O
not O
only O
being O
spied O
on O
by O
the O
Turla B-Organization
group O
who O
planted O
the O
backdoor O
, O
but O
also O
by O
other O
attackers O
. O

The O
developers O
refer O
to O
this O
tool O
by O
the O
name O
Kazuar B-Malware
, O
which O
is O
a O
Trojan B-Malware
written O
using O
the O
Microsoft.NET O
Framework O
that O
offers O
actors O
complete O
access O
to O
compromised O
systems O
targeted O
by O
its O
operator O
. O

We O
suspect O
the O
Kazuar B-Malware
tool I-Malware
may O
be O
linked O
to O
the O
Turla B-Organization
threat O
actor O
group O
( O
also O
known O
as O
Uroburos B-Organization
and O
Snake B-Organization
) O
, O

This O
is O
also O
a O
full-featured B-Malware
backdoor I-Malware
controlled O
by O
email O
, O
and O
which O
can O
work O
independently O
of O
any O
other O
Turla B-Organization
component O
. O

A O
hallmark O
of O
Turla B-Organization
operations O
is O
iterations O
of O
their O
tools O
and O
code O
lineage O
in O
Kazuar B-Malware
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
at O
least O
2005 O
. O

If O
the O
hypothesis O
is O
correct O
and O
the O
Turla B-Organization
threat O
group O
is O
using O
Kazuar B-Malware
, O
we O
believe O
they O
may O
be O
using O
it O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
Carbon B-Malware
and O
its O
derivatives O
. O

We O
used O
a O
combination O
of O

such O
as O
NoFuserEx B-Malware

, O
ConfuserEx B-Malware
Switch I-Malware
Killer I-Malware
, O
and O
de4d0t B-Malware
in O
order O
to O
deobfuscate O

for O

Kazuar B-Organization
generates O

e O
uncovered O
the O

of O
a O

which O
has O
Chinese O
origins O
. O

Also O
, O
by O
creating O
this O
type O
of O
API O
access O
, O
Turla B-Organization
could O
use O
one O
accessible O
server O
as O
a O
single O
point O
to O
dump O

to O
and O
exfiltrate O

According O
to O
our O
estimations O
, O
this O
group O
has O
been O
active O
for O
several O
years O

specializes O
in O
cyberattacks O
against O
the O
online O

we O

to O

APT5 B-Organization
has O

be O
on O

APT5 B-Organization

the O

Nearly O
a O
month O
later O
, O
security O
experts O
are O
now O
shining O
a O
bright O
light O
on O
the O
alert O
and O
the O
mysterious O
group O
behind O
the O
attack O
. O

The O
attacks O
discussed O
in O
this O
blog O
are O
related O
to O
an O
APT O
campaign O
commonly O
referred O
to O
as O
" O
th3bug O
" O
, O
named O
for O
the O
password O
the O
actors O
often O
use O
with O
their O
Poison B-Malware

malware I-Malware
. O

Over O
the O
summer O
they O
compromised O
several O
sites O
, O
including O
a O
well-known O
Uyghur O
website O
written O
in O
that O
native O
language O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
many O
other O
APT O
campaigns O
, O
which O
tend O
to O
rely O
heavily O
on O
spear O
phishing O
to O
gain O
victims O
, O
" O
th3bug O
" O
is O
known O
for O
compromising O
legitimate O
websites O
their O
intended O
visitors O
are O
likely O
to O
frequent O
. O

While O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
recover O
the O
initial O
vulnerability O
used O
, O
it O
is O
possibly O
the O
same O
CVE-2014-0515 O
Adobe O
Flash O
exploit B-Vulnerability
first O
reported O
by O
Cisco B-Organization
TRAC I-Organization
in O
late O
July O
. O

However O
, O
to O
increase O
success O
rates O
APT20 B-Organization
can O
use O
zero-day B-Vulnerability
exploits O
, O
so O
even O
a O
properly O
patched O
system O
would O
be O
compromised O
. O

Our O
direct O
observation O
of O
in-the-wild O
spearphishing O
attacks O
staged O
by O
the O
Bahamut O
group O
have O
been O
solely O
attempts O
to O
deceive O
targets O
into O
providing O
account O
passwords O
through O
impersonation O
of O
notices O
from O
platform O
providers O
. O

Bahamut O
was O
first O
noticed O
when O
it O
targeted O
a O
Middle O
Eastern O
human O
rights O
activist O
in O
the O
first O
week O
of O
January O
2017 O
. O

Later O
that O
month O
, O
the O
same O
tactics O
and O
patterns O
were O
seen O
in O
attempts O
against O
an O
Iranian O
women O
's O
activist O
– O
an O
individual O
commonly O
targeted O
by O
Iranian O
actors O
, O
such O
as O
Charming O
Kitten O
and O
the O
Sima O
campaign O
documented O
in O
our O
2016 O
Black O
Hat O
talk O
. O

In O
June O
we O
published O
on O
a O
previously O
unknown O
group O
we O
named O
" O
Bahamut B-Organization
" O
, O
a O
strange O
campaign O
of O
phishing O
and O
malware O
apparently O
focused O
on O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
South O
Asia O
. O

Once O
inside O
a O
network O
, O
APT40 B-Organization
uses O
credential-harvesting B-Malware
tools I-Malware
to O
gain O
usernames O
and O
passwords O
, O
allowing O
it O
to O
expand O
its O
reach O
across O
the O
network O
and O
move O
laterally O
through O
an O
environment O
as O
it O
moves O
to O
towards O
the O
ultimate O
goal O
of O
stealing O
data O
. O

Bahamut B-Organization
was O
shown O
to O
be O
resourceful O
, O
not O
only O
maintaining O
their O
own O
Android B-System
malware B-Malware
but O
running O
propaganda O
sites O
, O
although O
the O
quality O
of O
these O
activities O
varied O
noticeably O
. O

In O
June O
we O
published O
on O
a O
previously O
unknown O
group O
we O
named O
" O
Bahamut B-Organization
" O
, O
a O
strange O
campaign O
of O
phishing O
and O
malware O
apparently O
focused O
on O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
South O
Asia O
. O

Several O
times O
, O
APT5 B-Organization
has O
targeted O
organizations O
and O
personnel O
based O
in O
Southeast O
Asia O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
same O
week O
of O
September O
a O
series O
of O
spearphishing O
attempts O
once O
again O
targeted O
a O
set O
of O
otherwise O
unrelated O
individuals O
, O
employing O
the O
same O
tactics O
as O
before O
. O

Our O
primary O
contribution O
in O
this O
update O
is O
to O
implicate O
Bahamut O
in O
what O
are O
likely O
counterterrorism-motivated O
surveillance O
operations O
, O
and O
to O
further O
affirm O
our O
belief O
that O
the O
group O
is O
a O
hacker-for-hire O
operation O
. O

As O
we O
wrote O
then O
, O
compared O
to O
Kingphish O
, O
Bahamut O
operates O
as O
though O
it O
were O
a O
generation O
ahead O
in O
terms O
of O
professionalism O
and O
ambition O
. O

In O
the O
Bahamut O
report O
, O
we O
discussed O
two O
domains B-Malware
found O
within O
our O
search O
that O
were O
linked O
with O
a O
custom B-Malware
Android I-Malware
malware I-Malware
agent I-Malware
. O

After O
the O
publication O
of O
the O
original O
report O
, O
these O
sites O
were O
taken O
offline O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
one O
agent O
was O
even O
updated O
a O
six O
days O
prior O
to O
our O
post O
( O
the O
" O
Khuai B-Malware
" O
application O
) O
. O

FIF O
is O
notable O
for O
its O
links O
to O
the O
Lashkar-e-Taiba O
( O
LeT O
) O
terrorist O
organization O
, O
which O
has O
committed O
mass-casualty O
attacks O
in O
India O
in O
support O
of O
establishing O
Pakistani O
control O
over O
the O
disputed O
Jammu O
and O
Kashmir O
border O
region O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
it O
is O
already O
flagged O
as O
Bahamut O
by O
antivirus O
engines O
. O

Our O
initial O
observation O
of O
the O
Bahamut O
group O
originated O
from O
in-the-wild O
attempts O
to O
deceive O
targets O
into O
providing O
account O
passwords O
through O
impersonation O
of O
platform O
providers O
. O

One O
curious O
trait O
of O
Bahamut O
is O
that O
it O
develops O
fully-functional O
applications O
in O
support O
of O
its O
espionage O
activities O
, O
rather O
than O
push O
nonfunctional O
fake O
apps O
or O
bundle O
malware O
with O
legitimate B-Malware
software I-Malware
. O

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut O
appears O
to O
track O
password O
attempts O
in O
response O
to O
failed O
phishing O
attempts O
or O
to O
provoke O
the O
target O
to O
provide O
more O
passwords O
. O

Bahamut O
spearphishing O
attempts O
have O
also O
been O
accompanied O
with O
SMS O
messages O
purporting O
to O
be O
from O
Google O
about O
security O
issues O
on O
their O
account O
, O
including O
a O
class O
0 O
message O
or O
" O
Flash O
text O
" O
. O


These O
text O
messages O
did O
not O
include O
links O
but O
are O
intended O
to O
build O
credibility O
around O
the O
fake O
service O
notifications O
later O
sent O
to O
the O
target O
's O
email O
address O
. O

We O
have O
not O
found O
evidence O
of O
Bahamut B-Organization
engaging O
in O
crime O
or O
operating O
outside O
its O
limited O
geographic O
domains O
, O
although O
this O
narrow O
perspective O
could O
be O
accounted O
for O
by O
its O
compartmentalization O
of O
operations O
. O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut B-Organization
's O
campaigns O
have O
appeared O
to O
be O
primarily O
espionage O
or O
information O
operations O
– O
not O
destructive O
attacks O
or O
fraud O
. O

The O
targets O
and O
themes O
of O
Bahamut O

have O
consistently O
fallen O

two O

believed O
to O
be O
operated O
by O
a O

KIVARS B-Malware
are O
most O
likely O
to O
be O
used O
in O
first O
phase O

was O
in O
April O
2018 O

since O
that O
we O
observed O
a O
lot O
more O

ones O
. O

After O
performing O
investigations O
on O
the O
classified O
victims O
, O
we O
find O
the O
attacker O
targets O
big O
companies O

The O
oldest O

we've O
seen O
up O
to O
now O
is O
from O
November O
2013 O
. O

One O
of O
the O
top O

However O
, O
the O

is O
different O
in O
two O
respects O
: O
unlike O
other O
APTs O
, O
the O
main O

the O
Bookworm B-Malware
Trojan I-Malware
primarily O
in O
attacks O
on O

The O
threat O

use O
a O

Using O
XREFs B-Malware

static O
analysis O
is O
a O
common O
technique O
to O
quickly O
find O
where O
functions O
of O

. O

The O
developers O
designed O

be O
a O
modular B-Malware
Trojan I-Malware
not O
limited O
to O
just O
the O
initial O

, O
as O
Bookworm B-Malware
can O
also O
load O
additional O

provided O
by O

Although O
the O
developers O
of O

have O
included O
only O

in O

as O
a O
core O
ability O

as O
suggested O
in O

While O

we O

to O
obfuscate O
the O

The O

discussed O
the O

The O

we O
are O
aware O
of O

on O
at O
least O
two O
branches O
of O

Thailand O
. O

We O
speculate O
that O
other O
attacks O
delivering O
Bookworm B-Malware
were O
also O
targeting O
organizations O
in O
Thailand O
based O
on O
the O
contents O

that O
contain O
the O

. O

We O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
likely O
threat O

will O
continue O
development O
Bookworm B-Malware
, O
and O
will O
continue O
to O
use O

for O
the O

future O
. O

Threat O

have O
delivered O
Bookworm B-Malware
as O
a O
payload O
in O

Thailand O
. O

Analysis O
of O
compromised O

seen O
communicating O
with O
Bookworm B-Malware
C2 I-Malware

also O
confirms O
our O
speculation O
on O
targeting O
with O
a O
majority O
of O

existing O
within O
Thailand O
. O

As O
mentioned O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Bookworm B-Malware
, O
the O
Trojan B-Malware
sends O
a O
static O
date O
string O
to O
the O
C2 O
server O
that O
we O
referred O
to O
as O
a O
campaign O
code O
. O

We O
believed O
that O
the O
actors O
would O
use O
this O
date B-Malware
code I-Malware
to O
track O
their O
attack O
campaigns O
; O
however O
, O
after O
continued O
analysis O
of O
the O
malware O
, O
we O
think O
these O
static O
dates O
could O
also O
be O
a O
build O
identifier O
for O
the O
Trojan B-Malware
. O

Threat O
actors O
may O
use O
the O
date O
string O
hardcoded O
into O
each O
Bookworm B-Malware
sample I-Malware
as O
a O
build O
identifier O
. O

A O
Trojan B-Malware
sending O
a O
build O
identifier O
to O
its O
C2 O
server O
is O
quite O
common O
, O
as O
it O
notifies O
the O
threat O
actors O
of O
the O
specific O
version O
of O
the O
Trojan B-Malware
in O
which O
they O
are O
interacting O
. O

Due O
to O
these O
changes O
without O
a O
new O
date O
string O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
date O
codes O
are O
used O
for O
campaign O
tracking O
rather O
than O
a O
Bookworm B-Malware
build O
identifier O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Bookworm B-Malware
samples I-Malware
use O
the O
static O
date O
string O
as O
campaign O
codes O
, O
which O
we O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
approximate O
date O
of O
each O
attack O
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
detailed O

Buhtrap B-Organization
has O
been O
active O
since O
2014 O
, O
however O
their O
first O
attacks O
against O
financial O
institutions O
were O
only O
detected O
in O
August O
2015 O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
group O
is O
known O
to O
target O
Russian O
and O
Ukrainian O
banks O
. O

Buhtrap B-Organization
is O
the O
first O
hacker O
group O
using O
a O
network O
worm O
to O
infect O
the O
overall O
bank O
infrastructure O
that O
significantly O
increases O
the O
difficulty O
of O
removing O
all O
malicious O
functions O
from O
the O
network O
. O

Malicious O
programs O
intentionally O
scan O
for O
machines O
with O
an O
automated O
Bank-Customer O
system O
of O
the O
Central O

of O
Russia O
( O
further O

If O
the O

was O
delivered O
with O

instead O
of O

( O
CVE-2012-0158 O
, O
CVE-2013-3906 O
or O
CVE-2014-1761 O
) O
, O
then O
the O
document O
contained O
instructions O
for O
enabling O
macros O
. O

We O
noticed O
that O
criminals O
were O
spreading O
Buhtrap B-Organization
using O
this O
method O
from O
May O
2015 O
to O
August O
2015 O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
attackers O
used O
the O
same O
compromised B-Malware
websites I-Malware
to O
spread O
Buhtrap B-Malware
as O
those O
that O
had O
been O
used O
for O
the O
Corkow B-Malware
Trojan I-Malware
. O

Moreover O
, O
they O
used O
the O
same O
exploit B-Vulnerability
kit B-Vulnerability
Niteris I-Vulnerability
as O
that O
in O
the O
Corkow B-Malware
case O
. O

Purportedly O
during O
one O
of O
the O
first O
attacks O
hackers O
intercepted O
the O
mailing O
list O
of O
the O
Anti-drop O
" O
club O
and O
created O
a O
specific O
phishing O
email O
for O
its O
members O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
still O
widely O
used O
, O
notably O
in O
Russia O
. O

As O
noted O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Buhtrap O
, O
this O
gang O
has O
been O
actively O
targeting O
Russian O
businesses O
, O
mostly O
through O
spear-phishing O
. O

It O
is O
thus O
interesting O
to O
see O
Buhtrap O
add O
strategic O
web O
compromises O
to O
their O
arsenal O
. O

The O
first O
malware O
we O
saw O
was O
the O
lurk B-Malware
downloader I-Malware
, O
which O
was O
distributed O
on O
October O
26th O
. O

The O
executable O
would O
install O
the O
real O
Ammyy O
product O
, O
but O
would O
also O
launch O
a O
file O
called O
either O
AmmyyService.exe O
or O
AmmyySvc.exe O
which O
contained O
the O
malicious O
payload O
. O

Buhtrap B-Organization
is O
getting O
better O
at O
disguising O
the O
code O
they O
inject O
into O
compromised B-Malware
websites I-Malware
. O

With O
the O
recent O
arrests O
of O
actors O
using O
the O
Lurk B-Malware
banking I-Malware
trojan I-Malware
, O
Buhtrap O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
likely O
alternative O
for O
actors O
wishing O
to O
target O
Russian O
banks O
and O
software O
. O

They O
have O
different O
functions O
and O
ACTs O
of O
spreading O
, O
but O
the O
same O
purpose O
— O
to O
steal O
money O
from O
the O
accounts O
of O
businesses O
. O

Our O
experts O
have O
found O
that O
cybercriminals O
are O
actively O
focusing O
on O
SMBs B-Malware
, O
and O
giving O
particular O
attention O
to O
accountants O
. O

The O
first O
encounter O
with O
Buhtrap O
was O
registered O
back O
in O
2014 O
. O

For O
now O
, O
we O
can O
call O
RTM B-Malware
one O
of O
the O
most O
active O
financial O
Trojans O
. O

At O
that O
time O
it O
was O
the O
name O
of O
a O
cybercriminal O
group O
that O
was O
stealing O
money O
from O
Russian O
financial O
establishments O
— O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
at O
least O
$150,000 O
per O
hit O
. O

Buhtrap O
resurfaced O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
2017 O
in O
the O
TwoBee O
campaign O
, O
where O
it O
served O
primarily O
as O
means O
of O
malware O
delivery O
. O

After O
the O
source O
codes O
of O
their O
tools O
became O
public O
in O
2016 O
, O
the O
name O
Buhtrap O
was O
used O
for O
the O
financial B-Malware
Trojan I-Malware
. O

Just O
like O
last O
time O
, O
Buhtrap O
is O
spreading O
through O
exploits O
embedded O
in O
news O
outlets O
. O

Estimating O
the O
damages O
is O
challenging O
, O
but O
as O
we O
learned O
, O
the O
criminals O
are O
siphoning O
off O
assets O
in O
transactions O
that O
do O
not O
exceed O
$15,000 O
each O
. O

As O
explained O
later O
, O
we O
believe O
this O
campaign O
is O
financially-motivated O
and O
that O
it O
targets O
accounting O
departments O
in O
Russian O
businesses O
. O

" O
Buhgalter O
" O
means O

in O
Russian O
. O

Seeing O
a O
campaign O
like O
this O
, O
inevitably O
the O
Anunak/Carbanak B-Malware
documented O
by O
Fox-IT B-Organization
and O
Kaspersky B-Organization
comes O
to O
mind O
. O

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
similar O
, O
it O
uses O
a O
similar O
modified O

application O
, O
and O
it O
uses O
a O
third-party B-Malware
remote I-Malware

we O
discovered O

on O
spear-phishing O

. O

Sometimes O
, O
the O
attackers O
use O

on O
the O

websites O
, O
to O
make O
them O
seem O
more O

These O

some O

The O
CVE-2012-0773 O
was O
originally O
discovered O
by O
VUPEN O
and O
has O
an O
interesting O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O

attracted O
our O
attention O
by O
attempting O
to O
exploit B-Vulnerability

We O

when O
we O
observed O

a O

in O
January O
2014 O
. O

this O
is O
relatively O

primarily O
targets O
global O

that O
are O

. O

A O
Clever B-Organization

attack O
starts O
with O
the O
use O
of O
a O

to O
conduct O

. O

The O

was O

will O
attempt O
to O
upload O
a O
PHP O
backdoor O
to O
gain O
remote O

to O
the O

. O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
is O
likely O
the O
availability O
of O

against O

, O
which O
for O
a O

we O
found O
that O
they O

During O

Threat O
actors O
like O
Confucius B-Organization
and O
Patchwork B-Organization
are O
known O
for O
their O
large O
arsenal O
of O
tools O
and O
ever-evolving O
techniques O
that O
can O
render O
traditional O

solutions O
— O
which O
are O
often O
not O

to O
handle O
the O
persistent O
and O
sophisticated O
threats O
detailed O
in O
this O

— O
ineffective O
. O

The O
reality O
is O
that O
IT O
departments O
of O
small O
to O
large-sized O
organizations O
are O
not O
equipped O
to O
handle O
the O
more O
advanced O

that O

This O
blog O
post O
examines O
two O
similar O
malware O
families O
that O
utilize O
the O
aforementioned O
technique O
to O
abuse O
legitimate O
websites O
, O
their O
connections O
to O
each O
other O
, O
and O
their O
connections O
to O
known O
espionage O
campaigns O
. O

In O
order O
to O
increase O
the O
likelihood O
of O
their O
malware O
successfully O
communicating O
home O
, O
Cyber O
Espionage O
threat O
actors O
are O
increasingly O
abusing O
legitimate O
web O
services O
, O
in O
lieu O
of O

lookups O
to O
retrieve O
a O
command O
and O
control O
address O
. O

In O
2013 O
, O
Rapid7 B-Organization
reported O
on O
a O
series O
of O
relatively O
amateur O
attacks O
against O
Pakistani O
targets O
. O

The O
first O
of O
which O
we O
call O
' O
CONFUCIUS_A O
' O
, O
a O
malware O
family O
that O
has O
links O
to O
a O
series O
of O
attacks O
associated O
with O
a O
backdoor O
attack O
method O
commonly O
known O
as O
SNEEPY B-Malware
( O
aka O
ByeByeShell B-Malware
) O
first O
reported O
by O
Rapid7 B-Organization
in O
2013 O
. O

At O
first O
glance O
CONFUCIUS_B O
looks O
very O
similar O
to O
CONFUCIUS_A O
, O
and O
they O
are O
also O
packaged O
in O
plain O
SFX B-Malware
binary I-Malware
files I-Malware
. O

The O
CONFUCIUS_B O
executable O
is O
disguised O
as O
a O
PowerPoint O
presentation O
, O
using O
a O
Right-To-Left-Override O
( O
RTLO O
) O
trick O
and O
a O
false O
icon O
. O

We O
also O
believe O
that O
both O
clusters O
of O
activity O
have O
links O
to O
attacks O
with O
likely O
Indian O
origins O
, O
the O
CONFUCIUS_A O
attacks O
are O
linked O
to O
the O
use O
of O
SNEEPY/BYEBYESHELL B-Malware
and O
the O
CONFUCIUS_B O
have O
a O
loose O
link O
to O
Hangover B-Malware
. O

The O
two O
malware O
families O
themselves O
are O
also O
very O
similar O
, O
and O
therefore O
we O
think O
that O
the O
shared O
technique O
is O
an O
indication O
of O
a O
single O
developer O
, O
or O
development O
company O
, O
behind O
both O
CONFUCIUS_A O
and O
CONFUCIUS_B O
. O

In O
this O
blog O

, O
we O
discussed O
two O
separate O
malware O
variations O
that O
behave O
in O
very O
similar O
ACTs O
and O
use O
similar O
techniques O
to O
acquire O
a O
C2 O

, O
with O
both O
using O
Yahoo O

The O

that O
the O

targeted O
individuals O
affiliated O
with O
these O

. O

We O
believe O
that O
this O
is O
a O
new O
variant O
of O
VAMP B-Malware
, O
indicating O
that O
the O
threat O
actors O
behind O
APT-C-23 B-Organization
are O
still O
active O
and O
continuously O
improving O
their O

researchers O
came O
across O
a O
new O

. O

On O
Nov. O
27 O
, O
2018 O
, O
Cisco B-Organization

Talos I-Organization
research O

published O
a O
write-up O
outlining O
the O
contours O
of O
a O
sophisticated O
cyber O
espionage O
campaign O
it O
dubbed O
DNSpionage O
. O

Talos B-Organization
said O
the O
perpetrators O
of O
DNSpionage O
were O
able O
to O
steal O
email O
and O
other O
login O
credentials O
from O
a O
number O
of O
government O
and O
private O
sector O
entities O
in O
Lebanon O
and O
the O
United O
Arab O
Emirates O
by O
hijacking O
the O
DNS O
servers O
for O
these O
targets O
, O
so O
that O
all O
email O

virtual O
private O
networking O
( O

) O
traffic O
was O
redirected O
to O
an O
Internet O
address O
controlled O
by O
the O
attackers O
. O

Talos B-Organization
reported O
that O
these O
DNS O
hijacks O
also O
paved O
the O
ACT O
for O
the O
attackers O
to O
obtain O
SSL O
encryption O
certificates O
for O
the O
targeted O
domains O
( O
webmail.finance.gov.lb O
) O
, O
which O
allowed O

view O
them O
in O

We O

In O
this O

we O
cover O
a O
malicious O

called O
Octopus B-Malware
that O

discovered O
that O
Octopus B-Malware
is O
related O
to O

, O
something O
we O
reported O
in O
April O
2018 O
. O

From O
early O
2014 O
until O
December O
2018 O
, O

El O

one O
of O
these O
threats O
that O
was O
first O
publicly O
disclosed O
and O
named O
by O
Kaspersky B-Organization
here O
. O

We've O
found O
that O
this O
group O
has O
continued O
to O
operate O
successfully O
, O
predominantly O
in O
Latin O
America O
, O
since O
2014 O
. O

All O
attackers O
simply O
moved O
to O
new O
C2 O
infrastructure O
, O
based O
largely O
around O
dynamic O
DNS O
domains O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
making O
minimal O
changes O
to O
the O
malware O
in O
order O
to O
evade O
signature-based O
detection O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
Octopus B-Malware
, O
DustSquad O
used O
Delphi O
as O
their O
programming O
language O
of O
choice O
, O
which O
is O
unusual O
for O
such O
an O
actor O
. O

Targets O
included O
a O
wide O

high-profile O

Some O
time O
ago O
, O
a O
Kaspersky B-Organization
Lab I-Organization
customer O
in O
Latin O
America O
contacted O
us O
to O
say O
he O
had O
visited O
China O
and O
suspected O
his O
machine O
was O
infected O
with O
an O
unknown O
, O
undetected O
malware O
. O

It O
was O
a O
targeted O
attack O
we O
are O
calling O
" O
Machete O
" O
. O

At O
first O
look O
, O
it O
pretends O
to O
be O
a O
Java B-Malware
related I-Malware
application I-Malware
but O
after O
a O
quick O
analysis O
, O
it O
was O
obvious O
this O
was O
something O
more O
than O
just O
a O
simple O
Java O
file O
. O

" O
Machete O
" O
is O
a O
targeted O
attack O
campaign O
with O
Spanish O
speaking O
roots O
. O

The O
decoy B-Malware
slideshows I-Malware
all O
contain O
photos O
from O
very O
meaningful O
events O
to O
individuals O
in O
Thailand O
, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
actors O
continually O
look O
for O
impactful O
events O
to O
use O
to O
disguise O
their O
attacks O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
such O
as O
Russia O
, O
the O
target O
appears O
to O
be O
an O
embassy O
from O
one O
of O
the O
countries O
of O
this O
list O
. O

Both O
attackers O
and O
victims O
speak O
Spanish O
natively O
, O
as O
we O
see O
it O
consistently O
in O
the O
source O
code O
of O
the O

side O
and O
in O
the O

We O

as O

of O

that O

It O
is O

that O
the O

Since O
January O
2013 O
, O
we've O
been O
on O
the O

for O
a O
possible O
RedOctober B-Organization
comeback O

One O
possible O
hit O
was O
triggered O
when O
we O
observed O
Mevade O
, O
an O
unusual O
piece O
of O

that O
appeared O
late O
in O
2013 O
. O

In O
August O
2014 O
, O
some O
of O
our O
users O
observed O
targeted O
attacks O
with O
a O
variation O
of O
CVE-2012-0158 O
and O
an O
unusual O
set O
of O
malware O
. O

It O
wasn't O
until O
August O
2014 O
that O
we O
observed O
something O
which O
made O
us O
wonder O
if O
RedOctober O
is O
back O
for O
good O
. O

The O
Cloud O
Atlas O
implants O
utilize O
a O
rather O
unusual O
C&C O
mechanism O
. O

We O
named O
it O
RedOctober O
because O
we O
started O
this O
investigation O
in O
October O
2012 O
, O
an O
unusually O
hot O
month O
. O

The O
attackers O
upload O

the O

is O
downloaded O
by O
the O

Just O
like O
with O
RedOctober B-Organization
, O
the O
top O

of O

We O
noted O
in O

the O
large O
amount O
of O

citizens O
in O
this O
campaign O
, O

observed O
almost O
one-third O

Since O

2013 O
, O
we O
have O
observed O
activity O
from O
a O
unique O
threat O
actor O
group O
, O
which O
we O
began O
to O
investigate O
based O
on O
increased O

against O
human O

in O
the O
beginning O
of O
2015 O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
three O
years O
of O
observation O
of O
campaigns O
targeting O
civil O

Thanks O
to O

we O
have O
been O
able O
to O
collect O
during O
the O

, O
such O
as O
characteristics O
of O
the O
group O

and O
development O

, O
our O
research O
strongly O
supports O
the O
claim O
that O
the O
Infy B-Organization
group O
is O
of O
Iranian O
origin O
and O
potentially O
connected O
to O
the O
Iranian O
state O
. O

Amongst O
a O
backdrop O
of O
other O
incidents O
, O
Infy O
became O
one O
of O
the O
most O
frequently O
observed O
agents O
for O
attempted O
malware O
attacks O
against O
Iranian O
civil O
society O
beginning O
in O
late O
2014 O
, O
growing O
in O

up O
to O
the O
February O
2016 O

in O

Until O
the O
publication O
of O
the O

, O
the O
developers O
of O
the O
Infy B-Malware
appeared O
to O
be O
actively O

were O
distributed O

Over O
the O
months O
following O
the O
elections O
, O
the O
accounts O
of O
Iranians O
that O
had O
been O
compromised O
by O
the O

were O
then O
used O
for O
spreading O
the O
malware O
. O

When O

subsided O
, O
the O

instead O
appeared O
to O
have O
focused O
on O
external O

giving O
them O
persistent O

In O
the O

the O

The O

suspected O
Lurk B-Malware
of O
stealing O
nearly O
three O
billion O

, O
using O

systematically O
withdraw O
large O

from O
the O

of O

, O

When O
we O
first O
encountered O
Lurk B-Malware
, O
in O
2011 O
, O
it O
was O
a O
nameless O
Trojan B-Malware
. O

While O
the O

This O
article O
is O
an O
attempt O
to O
share O
this O
experience O
with O
other O
experts O
, O
particularly O
the O
IT O
security O
specialists O
in O
companies O
and O
financial O
institutions O
that O
increasingly O
find O
themselves O
the O
targets O
of O
cyber-attacks O
. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
the O
attackers O
only O
had O
to O
infect O
the O
computer O
on O
which O
the O
RBS O
software O
was O
installed O
in O
order O
to O
start O
stealing O
the O
cash O
. O

We O
were O
soon O
able O
to O
help O
investigate O
another O
incident O
involving O
Lurk B-Malware
. O

This O
event O
significantly O
affected O
the O
Russian O
cybercriminal O
world O
as O
the O
gang O
had O
stolen O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
rubles O
during O
a O
few O
years O
of O
activity O
, O
and O
was O
considered O
a O
" O
leader O
" O
among O
cybercriminals O
. O

In O
Russia O
, O
there O
were O
several O
relatively O
large O
cybercriminal O
groups O
engaged O
in O
financial O
theft O
via O
attacks O
on O
RBS O
. O

In O
April O
2013 O
, O
a O
year O
after O
we O
found O
the O
" O
bodiless O
" O
Lurk B-Malware
module I-Malware
, O
the O
Russian O
cybercriminal O
underground O
exploited O
several O
families O
of O
malicious O
software O
that O
specialized O
in O
attacks O
on O
banking O
software O
. O

Through O
the O
information O
exchanges O
used O
by O
people O
in O
the O
security O
industry O
, O
we O
learned O
that O
several O
Russian O
banks O
were O
struggling O
with O
malicious O
programs O
created O
specifically O
to O
attack O
a O
particular O
type O
of O
legal O
banking O
software O
. O

If O
it O
did O
, O
the O
malware O
downloaded O
additional O
modules O
, O
including O
ones O
allowing O
for O
the O
automatic O
creation O
of O
unauthorized O
payment O
orders O
, O
changing O

in O
legal O

orders O
, O
etc O
. O

As O
far O
as O
we O
can O
judge O
from O
the O
data O
we O
have O
, O
in O
2014 O
the O
criminal O
group O
behind O
Lurk B-Malware
seriously O
reduced O
its O

and O
" O

this O

RAT B-Malware
was O
part O

portfolio O
that O
included O
six O
other O

, O
based O
on O
the O
data O
that O
needed O
to O
be O
stolen O
from O

. O

According O
to O
the O
security O
experts O
, O
this O
collection O
of O
malware O
was O
discovered O
after O
their O
first O
initial O
report O
was O
published O
, O
meaning O
that O
Group O
27 O
ignored O
the O
fact O
they O
were O
unmasked O
and O
continued O
to O
infect O

through O
the O

, O
the O
Myanmar O
Union O

( O

) O
website O
. O

Trochilus O
RAT O
activity O
was O
discovered O
during O
both O
months O
of O
October O
and O
November O
2015 O
. O

From O
September O
2016 O
through O
late O
November O
2016 O
, O
a O
threat O
actor O
group O
used O
both O
the O
Trochilus B-Malware
RAT I-Malware
and O
a O
newly O
idenfied O
RAT B-Malware
we've O
named O
MoonWind B-Malware
to O
target O
organizations O
in O
Thailand O
, O
including O
a O
utility O
organization O
. O

We O
chose O
the O
name O
' O
MoonWind B-Malware
' O
based O
on O
debugging O
strings O
we O
saw O
within O
the O
samples O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
compiler O
used O
to O
generate O
the O
samples O
. O

The O
attackers O
compromised O
two O
legitimate B-Malware
Thai I-Malware
websites I-Malware
to O
host O
the O
malware O
, O
which O
is O
a O
tactic O
this O
group O
has O
used O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Both O
the O
Trochilus B-Malware
and O
MoonWind B-Malware
RATs I-Malware
were O
hosted O
on O
the O
same O
compromised O
sites O
and O
used O
to O
target O
the O
same O
organization O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

The O
attackers O
used O
different O
command B-Malware
and I-Malware
control I-Malware
servers I-Malware
( O
C2s O
) O
for O
each O
malware O
family O
, O
a O
tactic O
we O
believe O
was O
meant O
to O
thwart O
attempts O
to O
tie O
the O
attacks O
together O
using O
infrastructure O
alone O
. O

Further O
research O
led O
us O
to O
additional O
MoonWind B-Malware
samples I-Malware
using O
the O
same O
C2 O
( O
dns.webswindows.com O
) O
but O
hosted O
on O
a O
different O
compromised O
but O
legitimate B-Malware
website I-Malware
. O

The O
attacks O
in O
that O
case O
took O
place O
in O
late O
September O
to O
early O
October O
2016 O
and O
the O
attackers O
stored O
the O
MoonWind B-Malware
samples I-Malware
as O
RAR B-Malware
files I-Malware
, O
while O
in O
the O
November O
attacks O
the O
RATs B-Malware
were O
stored O
as O
executables O
. O

We O
were O
not O
able O
to O
find O
additional O
tools O
, O
but O
the O
attackers O
again O
compromised O
a O
legitimate O
Thai O
website O
to O
host O
their O
malware O
, O
in O
this O
case O
the O
student O
portal O
for O
a O
Thai O
University O
. O

Trochilus B-Malware
was O
first O
reported O
by O
Arbor B-Organization
Networks I-Organization
in O
their O
Seven O
Pointed O
Dagger O
report O
tying O
its O
use O
to O
other O
targeted O
Southeast O
Asia O

. O

The O
activity O
dates O
to O
at O
least O
2013 O
and O
has O
ties O
to O
multiple O
reports O
by O
other O
researchers O
. O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
MoonWind B-Malware
is O
yet O
another O
new O
tool O
being O
used O
by O
the O
group O
or O
groups O
responsible O
for O
that O
activity O
, O
indicating O
they O
are O
not O
only O
still O
active O
but O
continuing O
to O
evolve O
their O
playbook O

The O
samples O
provided O
were O
alleged O
to O
be O
targeting O
Tibetan O

On O
June O

, O
2013 O
, O
Rapid7 B-Organization
released O
an O

, O
also O
exploiting O
unknown O

in O
Microsoft O

, O
similarly O
patched O
by O

, O
but O
allegedly O
targeting O

in O
Vietnam O
and O
India O
. O

As O
we O
have O
seen O
in O
some O
previous O
targeted O
malware O
attacks O
, O
the O
attackers O
in O
this O
incident O
are O
taking O
advantage O
of O
services O
like O
changeIP O
. O

com O
to O
establish O
free O
subdomains O
in O
their O
infrastructure O
. O

Blending O

with O
legitimate B-Malware
traffic I-Malware
is O
a O
common O
tactic O
used O
by O
attackers O
to O
help O
fly O
under O
the O
radar O
. O

Subdomains O
at O
phmail.us O
have O
been O
linked O
to O
malicious O
activity O
dating O
back O
as O
far O
as O
December O
2011 O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
patterns O
of O
subdomain O
registration O
over O
time O
in O
DNS O
, O
TRAC B-Organization
believes O
this O
is O
an O
example O
where O
the O
attackers O
registered O
their O
own O
second-level O
domain O
. O

In O
this O
blog O

we'll O
analyze O
two O
specific O
incidents O
apparently O
targeting O

we'll O
describe O
the O

to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
for O
a O
lack O
of O
an O

call O
KeyBoy B-Malware
, O
due O
to O
a O
string O
present O
in O
one O
of O

We O
encountered O

In O
August O
and O
October O
2016 O
we O
observed O
a O

first O
discussed O
in O

This O
behavioural O

was O
previously O
mentioned O
in O

to O
KeyBoy B-Malware
in O
a O
2013 O
blog O
post O
by O

. O

These O
versions O
of O

differed O
from O
the O
one O
first O
described O
by O

in O
several O
ACTs O
, O
many O
of O
which O
will O

We O
believe O
the O
2013 O
, O
2015 O
, O
and O
2016 O
KeyBoy B-Malware

provide O
evidence O
of O

Chances O
are O
about O
even O
, O
though O

highly O
likely O
that O

this O

using O
Poison B-Malware

to O
have O
somewhat O
modified O
their O

attacks O
on O
the O
chemical O
industry O
are O
merely O
their O
latest O
attack O
wave O
. O

The O
goal O
of O
the O
attackers O
appears O
to O
be O
to O
collect O
intellectual O
property O
such O
as O
design O
documents O
, O
formulas O
, O
and O
manufacturing O
processes O
. O

The O
attack O
wave O
started O
in O
late O
July O
2011 O
and O
continued O
into O
midSeptember O
2011 O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
the O
attacks O
appears O
to O
be O
industrial O
espionage O
, O
collecting O
intellectual O
property O
for O
competitive O
advantage O
. O

They O
then O
moved O
on O
to O
the O
motor O
industry O
in O
late O
May O
. O

From O
late O
April O
to O
early O
May O
, O
the O

focused O
on O
human O

. O

Attackers O
then O
moved O
on O
to O
the O
motor O
industry O
in O
late O
May O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
current O
attack O
campaign O
against O
the O
chemical O
industry O
began O
. O

The O
attackers O
first O
researched O
desired O
targets O
and O
then O
sent O
an O
email O
specifically O
to O
the O
target O
. O

First O
, O
when O
a O
specific O
recipient O
was O
targeted O
, O
the O
mails O
often O
purported O
to O
be O
meeting O
invitations O
from O
established O
business O
partners O
. O

While O
the O
attackers O
used O
different O
pretexts O
when O
sending O
these O
malicious O
emails O
, O
two O
methodologies O
stood O
out O
. O

Secondly O
, O
when O
the O
emails O
were O
being O
sent O
to O
a O
broad O
set O
of O
recipients O
, O
the O
mails O
purported O
to O
be O
a O
necessary O
security O
update O
. O

The O
attacks O
were O
traced O
back O
to O
a O
computer O
system O
that O
was O
a O
virtual O
private O
server O
( O
VPS O
) O
located O
in O
the O
United O

. O

Attackers O
are O
sending O
malicious O
PDF B-Malware
and O

files I-Malware
, O
which O
use O

to O
drop O
variants O
of O

This O

was O
also O
used O

These O
attacks O
are O
primarily O
targeting O

in O
search O
of O
key O
intellectual O
property O
for O
competitive O
advantage O
, O
military O

in O
the O
Middle O

and O
unveiled O
ongoing O

in O
multiple O

. O

The O
attackers O
try O
to O
lure O

through O
spear O

that O
include O
compressed O

. O

We O
found O
that O
the O

behind O
this O

targeted O
mainly O
industrial O
, O
engineering O
and O
manufacturing O
organizations O
in O
more O
than O
30 O

, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
trace O
the O

back O
to O
March O
2015 O
. O

Operation O
Ghoul O
is O
one O
of O
the O
many O

recommends O
users O
to O
be O
extra O
cautious O
while O
checking O
and O
opening O
emails O
and O
attachments O
. O

The O
main O
point O
that O
sets O
Operation O
Groundbait O
apart O
from O
the O
other O
attacks O
is O
that O
it O
has O
mostly O
been O
targeting O
anti-government O
separatists O
in O
the O
self-declared O
Donetsk O
and O
Luhansk O
People O
's O
Republics O
. O

The O
attacks O
appear O
to O
be O
geopolitically O
motivated O
and O
target O
high O
profile O
organizations O
. O

The O
objective O
of O
the O
attacks O
is O
clearly O
espionage O
– O
they O
involve O
gaining O
access O
to O
top O
legislative O
, O
executive O
and O
judicial O
bodies O
around O
the O
world O
. O

The O
attackers O
have O
targeted O
a O
large O
number O
of O
organizations O
globally O
since O
early O
2017 O
, O
with O
the O
main O
focus O
on O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
North O
Africa O
( O
MENA O
) O
, O
especially O
Palestine O
. O

The O
attacks O
were O
initially O
discovered O
while O
investigating O
a O
phishing O
attack O
that O
targeted O
political O
figures O
in O
the O
MENA O
region O
. O

a O
number O
of O
other O
CIS O
countries O
, O
including O
Russia O
, O

The O
main O
reason O
for O
the O
increase O
in O
Potao B-Malware
detections O
in O
2014 O
and O
2015 O
were O
infections O
through O

The O
first O
Potao O

that O
we O
examined O
took O
place O
in O
August O
2011 O
. O

In O
March O
2014 O
, O
the O
gang O
behind O
Potao B-Malware
started O
using O
a O
new O
infection B-Malware
vector I-Malware
. O

Since O
March O
2015 O
, O
ESET B-Organization
has O
detected O
Potao B-Malware

at O
several O
high-value O
Ukrainian O

to O
the O
Korean O

. O

ScarCruft B-Organization
uses O
a O
multi-stage O
binary O
infection O
scheme O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
notable O
functions O
of O
the O
initial O
dropper B-Malware
is O
to O
bypass O
Windows B-System
UAC O
( O
User O

) O
in O
order O
to O
execute O
the O
next O

This O

uses O
the O
public O
privilege O

exploit B-Vulnerability
code O
CVE-2018-8120 O
or O
UACME B-Malware
which O
is O
normally O
used O
by O
legitimate O

. O

Afterwards O
, O
the O
installer O
malware O
creates O
a O

and O
a O
configuration O

from O
its O
resource O
and O
executes O
it O
. O

The O
downloader B-Malware
malware B-Malware
uses O
the O
configuration O

and O
connects O
to O
the O
C2 O

to O
fetch O
the O

The O
ScarCruft B-Organization
group O
keeps O
expanding O
its O
Exfiltration O
targets O
to O
steal O
further O
information O
from O
infected O

and O
continues O
to O
create O

We O
also O
discovered O
an O
interesting O
piece O
of O
rare O
malware B-Malware
created O
by O
this O
threat O
actor O
– O
a O
Bluetooth O

. O

We O
believe O
they O
may O
have O
some O
links O
to O
North O
Korea O
, O
which O
may O
explain O
why O
ScarCruft O
decided O
to O
closely O
monitor O
them O

ScarCruft O
also O
attacked O
a O
diplomatic O
agency O
in O
Hong O

, O
and O
another O
diplomatic O

. O

It O
appears O
ScarCruft B-Organization

, O
some O

more O
than O
25 O
countries O

In O
September O
2017 O
, O
we O
discovered O
Silence O
attack O
on O
financial O
institutions O
. O

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
a O
spear-phishing O
email O
with O
a O
malicious O
attachment O
. O

An O
interesting O
point O
in O
the O
Silence O
attack O
is O
that O
the O
cybercriminals O
had O
already O
compromised O
banking O
infrastructure O
in O
order O
to O
send O
their O
spear-phishing O
emails O
from O
the O

and O
look O
as O
unsuspicious O
as O
possible O
to O
future O
victims O
. O

The O
spear-phishing O
infection O
vector O
is O
still O
the O
most O
popular O
ACT O
to O
initiate O
targeted O
campaigns O
. O

We O
conclude O
that O
the O
actor O
behind O
the O
attack O
is O
Silence O
group O
, O
a O
relatively O
new O
threat O
actor O
that's O
been O
operating O
since O
mid-2016 O
. O

A O
preliminary O
analysis O
caught O
the O
attention O
of O
our O

Analysis O
and O
Intelligence O
team O
as O
it O
yielded O
interesting O
data O
that O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
shows O
that O
Silence O
was O
targeting O
employees O
from O
financial O
entities O
, O
specifically O
in O
the O
Russian O
Federation O
and O
the O
Republic O
of O
Belarus O
. O

As O
shown O
above O
, O
the O
threat O
runs O
several O
native B-Malware
binaries I-Malware
to O
collect O
useful O
information O
for O
its O
recon O
phase O
. O

The O
intelligence O
we O
have O
collected O
shows O
that O
Silence O
is O
part O
of O
a O
more O
extensive O
operation O
, O
still O
focused O
on O
financial O
institutions O
operating O
mainly O
on O
Russian O
territory O
. O

These O
spearphishing O
attempts O
represent O
an O
evolution O
of O
Iranian O
actors O
based O
on O
their O
social O
engineering O
tactics O
and O
narrow O
targeting O
. O

Based O
on O
file O
modification O
dates O
and O
timestamps O
of O
samples O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
observed O
campaign O
was O
initiated O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
February O
2016 O
, O
with O
the O
infrastructure O
taken O
offline O
at O
the O
start O
of O
March O
. O

While O
the O
Sima O
moniker O
could O
similarly O
originate O
from O
software O

, O
it O
is O
a O
common O
female O
Persian O
name O
and O
a O
Persian-language O
Word O
for O

Given O
its O
use O
in O
more O
advanced O
social O

campaigns O
against O
women O

, O
the O
label O
seem O
particularly O
apt O
. O

Samples O

resource O
names O
contained O
the O
family O

of O
prominent O
Iranians O
, O
and O
several O
of O
these O
individuals O
received O
the O
malware O
located O

In O
another O

mirrored O
an O

about O
the O

of O
a O

to O
impersonate O
the O

engage O
in O
spearphishing O
within O
hours O
of O
the O
legitimate O

. O

The O
server O
used O
to O
host O
these O
malware O
samples O
was O
located O
on O
the O
German O

All O
the O

to O
be O

been O
compiled O
between O
February O
29 O
and O
March O
1 O
2016 O
, O
shortly O
before O

the O

this O

of O

might O
be O
fresh O

These O
archives O
provide O
further O
indication O
that O
those O
entities O
behind O
the O

are O
Persian-language O

, O
due O
to O
the O
naming O
of O

in O
Persian O

For O
the O
sake O
of O
narrative O
we O
are O

to O
those O

major O
technology O

were O
compromised O

However O
, O
an O
investigation O
by O
Symantec B-Organization
has O
found O
that O
the O
group O
has O
been O
active O
since O
at O

March O
2012 O
and O
its O
attacks O
have O
not O
only O
continued O
to O
the O
present O
day O
, O
but O
have O
also O
increased O
in O
number O
. O

Symantec B-Organization
has O
to O
date O
discovered O
49 O
different O
organizations O
in O
more O
than O
20 O
countries O
that O
have O
been O
attacked O
by O
Butterfly O
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
four O
companies O
which O
have O
publicly O
acknowledged O
attacks O
, O
Symantec B-Organization
has O
identified O
five O
other O
large O
technology O
firms O
compromised O
by O
Butterfly O
, O
primarily O
headquartered O
in O
the O
US O
. O

In O
the O
first O
attack O
, O
Butterfly O
gained O
a O
foothold O
by O
first O
attacking O
a O
small O
European O
office O
belonging O
to O
one O
firm O
and O
using O
this O
infection O
to O
then O
move O
on O
to O
its O
US O
office O
and O
European O
headquarters O
. O

However O
, O
technology O
is O
not O
the O
only O
sector O
the O
group O
has O
focused O
on O
and O
Symantec B-Organization
has O
found O
evidence O
that O
Butterfly O
has O
attacked O
three O
major O
European O
pharmaceutical O
firms O
. O

Butterfly B-Organization
has O
also O
shown O
an O
interest O
in O
the O
commodities O
sector O
, O
attacking O
two O
major O
companies O
involved O
in O
gold O
and O
oil O
in O
late O
2014 O
. O

The O
company O
specializes O
in O
finance O
and O
natural O

specific O
to O
that O
region O
. O

The O
latter O
was O
one O
of O
at O
least O
three O
law O
firms O
Butterfly B-Organization
has O
targeted O
over O
the O
past O
three O
years O
. O

In O
many O

succeeded O
in O
compromising O
Microsoft B-Malware

simple O
XOR O

For O
example O
, O
Bisonal B-Organization
malware I-Organization
in O
2012 O
used O
send() O
and O
recv() O
APIs O
to O
communicate O
with O
its O
C2. O


This O
Bisonal O
variant O
used O
in O
the O
latest O
attack O
communicates O
with O
one O
of O
the O
following O
hard-coded O
C2 O
addresses O
by O
using O
the O
HTTP O

method O
on O

Previous O
reports O
have O
discussed O
Bisonal O
malware O
used O
in O
attacks O
against O
Japan O
, O
South O
Korea O
and O
Russia O
. O


This O
particular O
sample O
we O
found O
targeted O
an O
organization O
in O
Russia O
and O
there O
is O
a O
specific O
system O
language O
check O
for O

If O
it's O

the O

is O
not O
‘ipconfig’ O
, O
the O
threat O
converts O
the O
command O
result O
text O
encoding O
from O
Cyrillic O
to O
UTF-16 B-Malware

Similar O
to O
the O
Bisonal O
variant O
targeting O
the O
Russian O
organization O
, O
this O
sample O
was O
also O
disguised O
as O
PDF O
document O
. O

The O
installed O
EXE O
file O
is O
almost O
exactly O
the O
same O
as O
the O
DLL O
version O
of O
Bisonal O
variant O
used O
against O
the O
Russian O
organization O
. O


The O
targets O
are O
military O
or O
defense O
industry O
in O
particular O
countries O
, O
it O
used O

as O
document O
file O
, O
and O
using O
a O

to O
install O
the O
malware O
and O
decoy O
file O
. O


A O
previous O
campaign O
of O
this O
APT O
group O
was O
uncovered O
by O
Talos B-Organization
in O
June O
2017 O
, O
and O
since O
then O
very O
little O
of O
this O
operation O
was O
seen O
in O
the O
wild O
. O


ined O
in O
the O
archive O
is O
called O
DriverInstallerU.exe” O
but O
its O
metadata O
shows O
that O
its O
original O
name O
is O
Interenet O
Assistant.exe” O
. O


After O
reviewing O
all O
the O
malware O
functionalities O
, O
we O
are O
confident O
in O
saying O
that O
the O
attackers B-Organization
look O
for O
victims O
who O
answer O
well-defined O
characteristics O
and O
believe O
that O
further O
stages O
of O
the O
attack O
are O
delivered O
only O
to O
those O
who O
fit O
the O
specific O
victim O
profile O
. O


In O
this O
sample O
, O
however O
, O
the O
module O
names O
were O
changed O
from O
actors O
and O
characters’ O
names O
to O
car O
models O
, O
namely O
BMW_x1” O
, O
BMW_x2” O
and O
up O
to O
BMW_x8” O
. O


But O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
attackers B-Organization
known O
affection O
for O
decoy O
documents O
that O
pose O
as O
news O
summaries O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
date O
the O
campaign O
back O
to O
March O
2018 O
. O


With O
the O
experience O
gained O
from O
the O
APT O
attack O
that O
began O
in O
March O
2017 O
, O
it O
seems O
this O
campaign O
has O
evolved O
into O
an O
attack O
with O
new O
capabilities O
, O
and O
an O
even O
more O
specific O
target O
, O
over O
a O
year O
later O
. O


These O
unknown B-Organization
actors I-Organization
continued O
launching O
DDoS O
attacks O
over O
the O
next O
few O
years O
. O


For O
simplicity O
, O
Kaspersky B-Organization
is O
calling O
them O
the O
BlackEnergy I-Organization
APT O
group O
. O


Since O
the O
middle O
of O
2015 O
, O
one O
of O
the O
preferred O

has O
been O

A O
very O
good O
analysis O

overview O
of O
the O

The O
earliest O
signs O
of O
destructive O

with O
BlackEnergy B-Organization
go O
back O
as O
far O
as O
June O
2014 O
. O


BlackEnergy B-Organization
is O
a O
highly O
dynamic O
threat O
actor O
and O
the O
current O
attacks O
in O
Ukraine O
indicate O
that O
destructive O
actions O
are O
on O
their O
main O
agenda O
, O
in O

to O
compromising O
industrial O
control O

Kaspersky B-Organization

continue O

monitor O
the O
BlackEnergy B-Organization

deploy O
its O
main O
backdoor O
as O
well O
as O
other O
tools O
against O
various O

, O
but O
June O
2019 O
was O
the O
first O
time O
we O
saw O
the O
Buhtrap B-Organization

use O
a O

part O
of O

In O
that O

, O
CVE-2019-1132 O
, O
against O

However O
, O
as O
the O
shift O
in O

occurred O
before O
the O
source O

, O
we O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
the O

attacks O
against O

are O
also O

When O
Buhtrap B-Organization
was O
targeting O

, O
the O
decoy O

would O
typically O
be O

When O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
tell O
if O
there O
are O
geopolitical O
motives O
behind O
this O

by O
looking O
solely O
at O

multiple O

which O
displayed O

The O
recent O
wave O
of O

demonstrates O
that O
financially O

attacks O
are O
not O
simply O
a O
passing O

now O
be O

that O

The O

as O
a O

In O
the O
Sea O

campaign O
, O
Talos B-Organization
was O
able O
to O
identify O
two O
distinct O
groups O
of O
victims O
. O


The O
first O
group O
, O
we O
identify O
as O
primary O
victims O
, O
includes O
national O
security O
organizations O
, O
ministries O
of O
foreign O

, O
and O
prominent O

organizations O
. O


The O
threat O
actors B-Organization
behind O
the O
Sea O
Turtle O
campaign O
show O
clear O
signs O
of O
being O
highly O
capable O
and O
brazen O
in O
their O
endeavors O
. O


In O
most O
cases O
, O
threat O
actors B-Organization
typically O
stop O
or O
slow O
down O
their O
activities O
once O
their O
campaigns O
are O
publicly O
revealed O
. O


The O
threat O
actors B-Organization
behind O
the O
Sea O
Turtle O
campaign O
were O
successful O
in O
compromising O
entities O
by O
manipulating O
and O
falsifying O
DNS O
records O
at O
various O
levels O
in O
the O
domain O

. O


If O
an O
attacker B-Organization
was O
able O
to O
compromise O
an O
organization's O
network O
administrator O
credentials O
, O
the O
attacker O
would O
be O
able O
to O
change O
that O
particular O
organization's O
DNS O
records O
at O
will O
. O


If O
the O
attackers B-Organization
were O
able O
to O
obtain O
one O
of O
these O
EPP O
keys O
, O
they O
would O
be O
able O
to O
modify O
any O
DNS O

that O
were O
managed O
by O
that O
particular O

Captured O
legitimate O

The O
diagram O
below O
illustrates O
how O
we O
believe O
the O
actors O
behind O
the O
Sea O
Turtle O
campaign O
used O
DNS O
hijacking O
to O
achieve O
their O
end O
goals O
. O


As O
of O
early O
2019 O
, O
the O
only O
evidence O
of O
the O
spear-phishing O
threat B-Organization
vector I-Organization
came O
from O
a O
compromised O
organization's O
public O
disclosure O
. O


On O
January O

, O

Clearing O

, O
which O
is O
not O
an O
Internet O

point O
but O
rather O
is O
an O

provides O
support O
to O
Internet O
exchange O
points O
and O
the O
core O
of O
the O
domain O

, O
provided O
confirmation O
of O
this O
aspect O
of O
the O
actors’ B-Organization
tactics O
when O
it O
publicly O
revealed O
its O
internal O
DNS O
had O
been O
briefly O
hijacked O
as O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
compromise O
at O
its O
domain O
registrar O
. O


During O
a O
typical O
incident O
, O
the O
actor B-Organization
would O
modify O
the O
NS O
records O
for O
the O
targeted O
organization O
, O
pointing O
users O
to O
a O
malicious O
DNS O
server O
that O
provided O
actor-controlled O
responses O
to O
all O
DNS O
queries O
. O


The O
next O
step O
for O
the O
actor B-Organization
was O
to O
build O
MitM B-Malware
servers I-Malware
that O
impersonated O
legitimate O
services O
to O
capture O
user O

. O


In O
addition O
to O
the O
MitM B-Malware

IP O

published O
in O
previous O
reports O
, O
Talos B-Organization
identified O
16 O
additional B-Malware
servers I-Malware
leveraged O
by O
the O
actor B-Organization
during O
the O
observed O
attacks O
. O


The O
attackers B-Organization
would O
then O
use O
the O
certificate O
on O
actor-controlled O
servers O
to O
perform O
additional O
MitM B-Malware
operations O
to O
harvest O
additional O
credentials O
. O


In O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
victims O
were O
redirected O
to O
these O
actor-controlled B-Organization
servers B-Malware
displaying O
the O
stolen O
certificate O
. O


One O
notable O
aspect O
of O
the O
campaign O
was O
the O
actors' B-Organization
ability O
to O
impersonate O
VPN B-Malware
applications I-Malware
, O
such O
as O
Cisco O
Adaptive B-Malware
Security I-Malware
Appliance I-Malware
(ASA) O
products O
, O
to O
perform O
MitM O
attacks O
. O


At O
this O
time O
, O
we O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
the O
attackers B-Organization
found O
a O
new O
ASA O
exploit B-Vulnerability
. O


Rather O
, O
they B-Organization
likely O
abused O
the O
trust O
relationship O
associated O
with O
the O
ASA's B-Malware
SSL O
certificate O
to O
harvest O
VPN O
credentials O
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
to O
the O
victim's O
network O
. O


As O
an O
example O
, O
DNS O

indicate O
that O
a O

resolved O
to O
an O
actor-controlled B-Organization
MitM B-Malware

In O
another O
case O
, O
the O
attackers B-Organization
were O
able O
to O
compromise O
NetNod O
, O
a O
non-profit O
, O
independent O
internet O
infrastructure O
organization O
based O
in O
Sweden O
. O


Using O
this O
access O
, O
the O
threat O
actors B-Organization
were O
able O
to O
manipulate O
the O
DNS O
records O
for O
sa1[.]dnsnode[.]net O
. O


This O
redirection O
allowed O
the O
attackers B-Organization
to O
harvest O

of O

who O
manage O

with O
the O

of O
Saudi O

of O
the O
more O
recent O

, O
2019 O
, O
the O
threat O
actors B-Organization
targeted O
the O
Sweden-based O

firm O
Cafax O
. O


We O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
Sea O
Turtle O
was O
targeted O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
re-establish O
access O
to O
the O
NetNod O
network O
, O
which O
was O
previously O
compromised O
by O
this O
threat O
actor O
. O


Obtaining O
access O
to O
this O
ccTLD O
registrars O
would O
have O
allowed O
attackers B-Organization
to O
hijack O
any O

that O
used O

we O
believe O
that O
the O

highly O
successful O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O


Had O
more O

such O
as O

, O
attackers B-Organization
would O
be O
unable O

many O
of O
these O

. O


On O
December O
25 O
, O
2016 O
, O
the O
NewsBeef B-Organization
APT O
stood O
up O
a O
server O
to O
host O
a O
new O
set O
of O
Microsoft O
Office O
documents O
(maintaining O
malicious O
macros O
and O
PowerShell O
scripts) O
to O
support O
its O
spear-phishing O
operations O
. O


These O
compromised O
servers O
include O
Saudi O
Arabian O
government O
servers O
and O
other O
high-value O
organizational O

relevant O
to O
NewsBeef's B-Organization
targets O

However O
, O

as O
well O
as O

arriving O
through O
the O
Outlook O

Interestingly O
, O
NewsBeef B-Organization
set O
up O
its O
server O
using O
the O
hosting O
provider O
Choopa B-Malware
, O
LLC B-Malware
, O

, O
the O
same O
hosting O

that O
the O

used O
in O
attacks O
over O
the O
summer O
of O
2016 O
. O


NTG’s O
IT O
focus O
and O
client O
list O
likely O
aided O
NewsBeef’s B-Organization
delivery O
of O
malicious O
PowerShell-enabled O
Office O

and O
poisoned O

. O


In O
other O
schemes O
, O
NewsBeef B-Organization

The O
law O

in O
this O

and O
is O
the O
sole O

Starting O
in O
October O
2016 O
, O
NewsBeef B-Organization
compromised O
a O

For O
example O
, O
on O
a O
Saudi O
government O
website O
, O
the O
NewsBeef B-Organization
APT O
delivered O
packed O

A O
high O
volume O
of O
redirections B-Organization
from O
the O
compromised O
site O
continues O
into O
mid-January O
2017 O
. O


However O
, O
as O
this O
recent O
campaign O
indicates O
, O
the O
NewsBeef B-Organization
APT O
appears O
to O
have O
shifted O
its O
intrusion O
toolset O
aACT O
from O
BeEF O
and O
towards O
macro-enabled O
malicious O
Office B-Malware
documents I-Malware
, O
PowerSploit B-Malware
, O
and O
Pupy B-Malware
. O


Despite O
this O
shift O
in O
toolset O
, O
the O
group O
still O
relies O
on O
old O
infrastructure O
as O
evidenced O
by O
their O
reuse O
of O
servers O
hosted O
by O
the O
service O
providers O
Choopa O
and O
Atlantic.net O
. O


Its O
attack O
activities O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
April O
2012 O
. O


The O
OceanLotus B-Organization
reflects O
a O
very O
strong O
confrontational O
ability O
and O
willing O
to O
attack O
by O
keep O
evolving O
their O
techniques O
. O


These O
APT O
attacks O
and O
adopting O
confrontation O
measures O
will O
exist O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O


OceanLotus’ B-Organization

we O
identified O
two O
methods O
to O

the O

The O
link O
to O
the O
final O
payload O
of O

was O
still O
active O
during O
the O
time O
of O

and O
hence O
we O
were O
able O
to O
download O
a O

While O

we O

multiple O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O

that O

to O
be O
another O
symptom O
of O
escalating O

in O

The O

With O

and O
false O

increasingly O
being O
employed O
by O

actors B-Organization
, O
attribution O
is O
a O
hard O
and O
complicated O
task O
that O
requires O
solid O
evidence O
, O
especially O
in O
complex O
regions O
such O
as O
the O
Middle O

The O

when O

starts O
communicating O
with O
the O
C&C O
server O
by O
sending O
basic O
information O
about O
the O

The O

basically O
provides O
a O
remote O
CMD/PowerShell B-Malware

for O

What O
lied O
beneath O
this O
facade O
was O
a O
well-engineered O
campaign O
of O

designed O
to O
steal O

spy O
on O
the O

of O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
in O
December O
2016 O
, O
Amnesty O
International O
published O
an O
investigation O
into O
another O
social O

campaign O
perpetrated O
by O
a O
seemingly O
fake O
human O

known O
as O

which O
targeted O
international O
human O

and O
labour O

organizations O
campaigning O
on O

in O
Qatar O
. O


It O
appears O
that O
the O
attackers B-Organization
may O
have O
impersonated O
the O
identity O
of O
a O
real O
young O

and O
stole O
her O

to O
construct O
the O
fake O

stolen O

In O
the O
course O
of O
this O

the O

then O
sent O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
invitations O
to O
access O
several O

The O
attackers B-Organization
were O
meticulous O
in O
making O
their O

as O
credible O
as O
possible O
. O


Among O
the O

of O
this O

a O
clear O
underlying O

, O
it O
is O
also O
hypothetically O

Operation B-Organization
Pawn I-Organization
Storm I-Organization
is O
an O
active O
economic O
and O
political O
cyber-espionage O
operation O
that O
targets O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
entities O
, O
like O
the O
military O
, O
governments O
, O
defense O
industries O
, O
and O
the O
media O
. O


we O
believe O
the O
iOS O
malware O
gets O
installed O
on O
already O
compromised O
systems O
, O
and O
it O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
next O
stage O
SEDNIT O
malware O
we O
have O
found O
for O
Microsoft O
Windows’ O
systems O
. O


we O
found O
two O
malicious O
iOS O
applications O
in O
Operation O
Pawn O
Storm O
. O


One O
is O
called O
XAgent O
detected O
as O
IOS_XAGENT.A O
and O
the O
other O
one O
uses O
the O
name O
of O
a O
legitimate O
iOS O
game O
, O
MadCap O
detected O
as O
IOS_ O
XAGENT.B O
. O


The O
obvious O
goal O
of O
the O
SEDNIT-related B-Organization
spyware O
is O
to O
steal O
personal O

, O

audio O
, O
make O

and O
send O
them O
to O
a O

we O
discovered O
a O

The O
dropper O
first O
appeared O
in O
mid-July O
, O
suggesting O
that O
this O
APT O
activity O
is O
potentially O
ongoing O
, O
with O
Turla B-Organization
actively O
targeting O
G20 O
participants O
and/or O
those O
with O
interest O
in O
the O
G20 O
, O
including O
member O
nations O
, O
journalists O
, O
and O
policymakers O
. O


Turla B-Organization
is O
a O
well-documented O
, O
long O
operating O
APT O
group O
that O
is O
widely O
believed O
to O
be O
a O
Russian O
state-sponsored O
organization O
. O


Turla B-Organization
is O
perhaps O
most O
notoriously O
suspected O
as O
responsible O
for O
the O
breach O
of O
the O
United O
States O
Central O
Command O
in O
2008 O
. O


More O
recently O
Turla B-Organization
was O
accused O
of O
breaching O
RUAG O
, O
a O
Swiss O
technology O
company O
, O
in O
a O
public O
report O
published O
by O
GovCERT.ch B-Organization

The O
delivery O
of O
KopiLuwak O
in O
this O
instance O
is O
currently O
unknown O
as O
the O
MSIL O
dropper O
has O
only O
been O
observed O
by O
Proofpoint B-Organization
researchers O
on O
a O
public O
malware O
repository O
. O


Assuming O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak O
has O
been O
observed O
in O
the O
wild O
, O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O
ACTs O
it O
may O
have O
been O
delivered O
including O
some O
of O
Turla’s B-Organization
previous O
attack O
methods O
such O
as O
spear O
phishing O
or O
via O
a O
watering O
hole O
. O


This O
could O
include O
diplomats O
, O
experts O
in O
the O
LOCs O
of O
interest O
related O
to O
the O
Digital O

Task O

Turla's B-Organization
goal O
could O
include O
diplomats O
, O
experts O
in O
the O
LOCs O
of O
interest O
related O
to O
the O
Digital O
Economy O
Task O
Force O
, O
or O
possibly O
even O
journalists O
. O


The O
earliest O
step O
in O
any O
possible O
attack(s) O
involving O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak O
of O
which O
Proofpoint O
researchers O
are O
currently O
aware O
begin O
with O
the O
MSIL O
dropper O
. O


The O
basic O
chain O
of O
events O
upon O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL O
dropper O
include O
dropping O
and O
executing O
both O
a O
PDF O
decoy O
and O
a O
Javascript O
(JS) O
dropper O
. O


As O
explained O
in O
further O
detail O
below O
, O
the O
JS O
dropper O
ultimately O
installs O
a O
JS O
decryptor O
onto O
an O
infected O
machine O
that O
will O
then O
finally O
decrypt O
and O
execute O
the O
actual O
KopiLuwak O
backdoor O
in O
memory O
only O
. O


As O
Proofpoint B-Organization
has O
not O
yet O
observed O
this O
attack O
in O
the O
wild O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
there O
is O
an O
additional O
component O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL O
payload O
. O


The O
newer O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak O
is O
now O
capable O
of O
exfiltrating O
files O
to O
the O
C&C O
as O
well O
as O
downloading O
files O
and O
saving O
them O
to O
the O
infected O
machine O
. O


Despite O
the O
added O
capabilities O
, O
we O
still O
agree O
with O
Kaspersky B-Organization
that O
this O
backdoor O
is O
likely O
used O
as O
an O
initial O
reconnaissance O
tool O
and O
would O
probably O
be O
used O
as O
a O
staging O
point O
to O
deploy O
one O
of O
Turla’s B-Organization
more O
fully O
featured O
implants O
. O


Turla B-Organization
is O
a O
complex O
cyberattack O
platform O
focused O
predominantly O
on O
diplomatic O
and O
government-related O
targets O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
, O
Central O
and O

Europe O
, O
North O
and O

We O
didn’t O
choose O
to O
name O
it O
after O
a O
vegetable; O
the O
.NET O
malware O
developers O
named O
it O
Topinambour O
themselves O
. O


The O
role O
of O
the O
.NET O
module O
is O
to O
deliver O
the O
known O
KopiLuwak O
JavaScript O
Trojan B-Malware
. O


Moreover O
, O
Turla B-Organization
now O
also O
has O
a O
heavily O
obfuscated O
PowerShell O
Trojan O
that O
is O
similar O
to O
KopiLuwak O
. O

These O
campaign-related O
VPSs O
are O
located O
in O
South O
Africa O
. O

The O
tool O
does O
all O
that O
a O
typical O
Trojan O
needs O
to O
accomplish: O
upload O
, O
download O
and O
execute O
files O
, O
fingerprint O
target O
systems O
. O

The O
PowerShell O
version O
of O
the O
Trojan B-Malware
also O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
get O
screenshots O
. O

The O
Trojan B-Malware
is O
quite O
similar O
to O
the O
.NET O
RocketMan B-Malware
Trojan B-Malware
Obviously O
and O
can O
handle O
the O
same O
commands; O
additionally O
, O
it O
includes O
the O
#screen” O
command O
to O
take O
a O
screenshot O
. O

The O
usage O
of O
KopiLuwak B-Malware
, O
a O
well-known O
and O
exclusive O
artefact O
previously O
used O
by O
the O
Turla B-Organization
group O
, O
makes O
us O
attribute O

to O
this O
actor O
with O
high O
confidence O

This O

especially O
of O

. O

They O
are O

” O
says O
Costin B-Organization
Raiu I-Organization
, O
who O
has O
been O
watching O

since O
2011 O
. O

Raiu B-Organization

his O
team O
have O
followed O
the O
digital O
tracks O
left O
behind O
by O
some O
of O
the O
Winnti B-Organization
hackers O
. O

One O
government O
official O
puts O
it O
very O
matter-of-factly: O
Winnti B-Organization
is O
very O
specific O
to O
Germany O
. O

By O
2014 O
, O
the O
Winnti B-Organization
malware O
code O
was O
no O
longer O
limited O
to O
game O
manufacturers O
. O


Winnti B-Organization
is O
targeting O
high-tech O
companies O
as O
well O
as O
chemical O

companies O
. O


Winnti B-Organization
is O
attacking O
companies O
in O
Japan O
, O
France O
, O
the O
U.S. O
and O
Germany O
. O


The O
Winnti B-Organization
hackers O
broke O
into O
Henkel’s O
network O
in O
2014 O
. O


Henkel B-Organization
confirms O
the O
Winnti B-Organization
incident O
and O
issues O
the O
following O
statement: O
The O
cyberattack O
was O
discovered O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2014 O
and O
Henkel O
promptly O
took O
all O
necessary O
precautions O
. O


Far O
from O
attacking O
Henkel O
and O
the O
other O
companies O
arbitrarily O
, O
Winnti B-Organization
takes O
a O
highly O
strategic O
approach O
. O


The O
hackers O
behind O
Winnti B-Malware
have O
also O
set O
their O
sights O
on O
Japan’s O
biggest O
chemical O
company O
, O
Shin-Etsu O
Chemical O
. O


In O
the O
case O
of O
another O
Japanese O
company O
, O
Sumitomo O

, O
Winnti B-Organization
apparently O
penetrated O
their O
networks O
during O
the O
summer O
of O
2016 O
. O


Winnti B-Organization
hackers O
also O
penetrated O
the O
BASF O
and O
Siemens O
networks O
. O


Thanks O
to O
this O

, O
we O
found O
out O
back O
in O
March O
2019 O
that O
the O

had O
been O
hacked O
by O

, O
the O
Winnti B-Organization
hackers O
had O
already O
been O

, O
playing O

even O
running O

From O
the O
time O
of O

started O
working O
at O

as O
early O
as O

APT41 B-Organization
activity O

of O
the O

Unlike O

APT41 B-Organization
conducts O

Although O

30 O

although O
global O

APT41 B-Organization
continuously O
returns O
to O
targeting O
the O
video O

sector O
and O
seems O
to O
have O
matured O
its O
campaigns O
through O
lessons O
learned O
in O
operations O
against O
the O
industry O
. O


We O
believe O
these O
operations O
include O
broadly O
malicious O
activity O
that O
can O
enable O
further O
operations O
, O
such O
as O
targeting O
game B-Malware

, O
while O
other O
activities O
are O
explicitly O

, O
such O
as O
abusing O
in-game O

mechanics O
. O


In O
October O
2012 O
, O
APT41 B-Organization
used O
captured O
credentials O
to O
compromise O
a O

server O
and O
access O
a O
production O
environment O
where O
they O
deployed O
a O
Linux B-System
version O
of O

. O


Since O
at O
least O
2012 O
, O
APT41 B-Organization
has O
repeatedly O
gained O
access O
to O
game O
development O
environments O
within O
affected O
companies O
, O
including O
online O
multiplayer O
networks O
, O
as O
well O
as O
targeting O
of O
production O
database O
administrators O
. O


APT41 B-Organization
has O
been O
observed O
inserting O
malicious O
code O
into O
legitimate O
video O
game O
files O
to O
distribute O
malware O
. O


In O
2018 O
, O
the O
group O
inserted O
CRACKSHOT O
malware O
into O
game O
files O
that O
were O
signed O
with O
legitimate O
codesigning O

, O
most O
likely O
indicating O
access O
to O
the O
production O
environment O
, O
which O
facilitated O
a O
supply O
chain O
compromise O
. O


We O
have O
also O
observed O
APT41 B-Organization
limitedly O
deploy O
rootkits O
on O
Linux B-System

Master O
Boot O
Record O
(MBR) O
bootkits O
, O
such O
as O
ROCKBOOT B-Malware
, O
on O
Windows B-System
systems O
to O
hide O
their O
malware O
and O
maintain O
persistence O
on O
victim O
systems O
. O


Selective O
deployment O
of O
ROCKBOOT B-Organization
suggests O
that O
APT41 B-Organization
reserves O
more O
advanced O
TTPs O
and O
malware O
only O
for O
high-value O
targets O
. O


APT41 B-Organization
has O
blatantly O
engaged O
in O
financially O

activity O
targeting O
the O

industry O
, O
including O
manipulating O
virtual O

In O
a O
highly O

, O
APT41 B-Organization
attempted O
to O
extort O
a O

by O
deploying O
the O
Encryptor O

. O


APT41 B-Organization
is O
well-known O
for O
leveraging O
compromised O
digital O
certificates O
from O
video O
game O
studios O
to O
sign O
malware O
. O


We O
suggest O
that O
APT41 B-Organization
sought O
to O
target O
in-game O
currency O
but O
found O
they O
could O
not O
monetize O
the O
specific O
targeted O
game O
, O
so O
the O
group O
resorted O
to O
ransomware O
to O
attempt O
to O
salvage O
their O
efforts O
and O
profit O
from O
the O
compromise O
. O


APT41 B-Organization
has O
also O
used O
credentials O
compromised O
in O
previous O
operations O
. O


In O
2014 O
, O
APT41 B-Organization
compromised O
an O
online O
billing/payment O

access O
between O
a O
third-party O

and O
the O

Although O
we O
do O
not O
have O
first-hand O
evidence O
of O
APT41's O

we O
have O
observed O

As O
demonstrated O
in O
operations O
targeting O
the O
video O

, O
APT41 B-Organization
leverages O
a O
variety B-Malware
of I-Malware

to O
access O
production O
environments O
where O
they O
can O

groups O
, O
and O
evidence O
suggests O
APT41 B-Organization
has O
conducted O
simultaneous O
cyber O
crime O
and O
Cyber O
Espionage O
operations O
from O
2014 O
onward O
. O


APT41 B-Organization
operations O
against O
higher O
education O
, O
travel O
services O
, O
and O
news/media O
firms O
provide O
some O
indication O
that O
the O
group O
also O
tracks O
individuals O
and O
conducts O
surveillance O
. O


For O
example O
, O
the O
group O
has O
repeatedly O
targeted O
call O
record O
information O
at O
telecom O
companies O
. O


APT41 B-Organization
has O
established O
and O
maintained O
strategic O
access O
to O
organizations O
in O
the O
healthcare O
, O
high-tech O
, O
and O
telecommunications O
sectors O
. O


The O
group’s O
financially O
motivated O
activity O
has O
primarily O
focused O
on O
the O
video O
game O
industry O
, O
where O
APT41 B-Organization
has O
manipulated O
virtual O
currencies O
and O
even O
attempted O
to O
deploy O
ransomware O
. O


In O
another O
instance O
, O
APT41 B-Organization
targeted O
a O
hotel’s O
reservation O
systems O
ahead O
of O
Chinese O
officials O
staying O
there O
, O
suggesting O
the O
group O
was O
tasked O
to O
reconnoiter O
the O
facility O
for O
security O
reasons O
. O


These O
supply O
chain O
compromise O
tactics O
have O
also O
been O
characteristic O
of O
APT41’s B-Organization
best O
known O
and O
most O
recent O
espionage O
campaigns O
. O


Interestingly O
, O
despite O
the O
significant O
effort O
required O
to O
execute O
supply O
chain O
compromises O
and O
the O
large O
number O
of O
affected O
organizations O
, O
APT41 B-Organization
limits O
the O
deployment O
of O
follow-on O
malware O
to O
specific O
victim O
systems O
by O
matching O
against O
individual O
system O
identifiers O
. O


Mapping O
the O
group’s O
activities O
since O
2012 O
(Figure O
2) O
also O
provides O
some O
indication O
that O
APT41 B-Organization
primarily O
conducts O
financially O
motivated O
operations O
outside O
of O
their O
normal O
day O
jobs O
. O


The O
latter O
is O
especially O
notable O
because O
APT41 B-Organization
has O
repeatedly O
returned O
to O
targeting O
the O
video O
game O
industry O
and O
we O
believe O
these O
activities O
were O
formative O
in O
the O
group’s O
later O
espionage O
operations O
. O


APT41 B-Organization
leverages O
an O
arsenal O
of O
over O
46 O
different O
malware B-Malware
families I-Malware
and O
tools B-Malware
to O
accomplish O
their O
missions O
, O
including O
publicly O
available O
utilities O
, O
malware O
shared O
with O
other O
Chinese O
espionage O
operations O
, O
and O
tools O
unique O
to O
the O
group O
. O


Once O
in O
a O
victim O
organization O
, O
APT41 B-Organization
can O
leverage O
more O
sophisticated O
TTPs O
and O
deploy O
additional O
malware O
. O


APT41 B-Organization
often O
relies O
on O
spear-phishing O
emails O
with O
attachments O
such O
as O
compiled O
HTML O
( O
.chm O
) O
files O
to O
initially O
compromise O
their O
victims O
. O

APT41 B-Organization
has O
also O
deployed O
rootkits O
and O
Master O
Boot O
Record O
(MBR) O
bootkits O
on O
a O
limited O
basis O
to O
hide O
their O
malware O
and O
maintain O
persistence O
on O
select O
victim O
systems O
. O


The O
limited O
use O
of O
these O
tools O
by O
APT41 B-Organization
suggests O
the O
group O
reserves O
more O
advanced O
TTPs O
and O
malware O
only O
for O
high-value O
targets O
. O


Like O
other O
Chinese O
espionage O
operators O
, O
APT41 B-Organization
appears O
to O
have O
moved O
toward O
strategic O
intelligence O
collection O
and O
establishing O
access O
and O
aACT O
from O
direct O
intellectual O
property O
theft O
since O
2015 O
. O


This O
shift O
, O
however O
, O
has O
not O
affected O
the O
group's B-Organization
consistent O
interest O
in O
targeting O
the O
video O
game O
industry O
for O
financially O
motivated O
reasons O
. O

Some O
parts O
of O
the O

were O
briefly O
described O
by O
a O
Serbian B-Organization
security I-Organization
provider O
in O
2016 O
and O
the O
Croatian O

The O

from O
January O

the O
time O
of O

the O
most O

in O
our O

are O
from O
July O
2019 O

Our O
findings O
show O
that O
the O
mentioned O
attacks B-Organization
have O
been O
orchestrated O
and O
we O
consider O
them O
a O
single O
long-term O
campaign O
that O
spans O
Croatia O
, O
Serbia O
, O
Montenegro O
, O
and O
Bosnia O

According O
to O
our O

In O
some O
of O
the O

, O
they O

Based O
on O

we O
believe O
this O

to O
be O
active O
from O
May O

uncovered O
a O
broader O

We O
expect O
to O

Let’s O
take O
a O
closer O
look O
at O
ITG08’s B-Organization
TTPs O
that O
are O
relevant O
to O
the O
campaign O
we O
investigated O
, O
starting O
with O

include O
the O

and O
running O

determined O
that O
the O

Once O
the O
ITG08 B-Organization
established O
a O
foothold O
on O
the O
network O
, O
they O
employed O
WMI B-Malware
and O
PowerShell B-Malware
techniques O
to O
perform O
network O
reconnaissance O
and O
move O
laterally O
within O
the O

used O
this O
technique O
to O
remotely O

In O
addition O
to O
the O

campaigns O
has O
been O
the O

Mimikatz O
is O
a O

Beyond O
using O

, O
ITG08 B-Organization
in O
this O

to O
carry O
out O
the O
different O
stages O
of O

After O
injecting O

, O
the O

After O
the O

resulted O
in O
a O
successful O

, O
ITG08 B-Organization
used O
the O

Stylistically O
, O
the O

with O
LYCEUM’s B-Organization
targeting O
of O

Despite O
the O

However O
, O
CTU B-Organization
researchers O
cannot O
dismiss O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
LYCEUM B-Organization
could O
seek O
access O
to O
OT O

after O
establishing O
robust O

LYCEUM B-Organization
is O
an O
emerging O
threat O
to O

Based O
on O
the O

, O
we O
believe O
the O

Both O
of O
these O

During O
our O

Lastly O
, O
we O
saw O
the O

The O

However O
, O
using O
NCC B-Organization
Group’s O
research O
published O
in O
May O
2018 O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
discover O
code O

between O
these O
DLLs O
and O
a O
sideloaded O
DLL O
that O
ran O
the O
SysUpdate O

that O
the O
NCC B-Organization

has O
associated O
with O
an O

The O
list O
also O
includes O
several O
hack B-Malware
tools I-Malware
, O
such O
as O
Mimikatz B-Malware
for O

several O
compiled O

Unfortunately O
, O
we O
do O
not O
have O
access O
to O
the O

, O
so O
we O

and O
we O
first O
saw O
the O

We O
believe O
the O

Once O

a O

that O
we O
temporarily O
called O
CopyPaste” O

The O
first O
of O
them O
is O
the O
well-known O
FIN7 B-Organization

which O
specializes O
in O
attacking O
various O

The O
second O

is O

, O
which O
uses O
the O

but O
targets O
only O

we O
observe O
, O
with O
various O
level O
of O
confidence O
, O
that O
there O
are O
several O

groups B-Organization
using O
very O
similar B-Malware
toolkits I-Malware
and O
the O
same O
infrastructure B-Malware
to O
conduct O
their O
cyberattacks O
. O


The O
last O
piece O
is O
the O
newly O
discovered O
CopyPaste B-Organization
group O
, O
who O
targeted O
financial O
entities O
and O
companies O
in O
one O
African O
country O
, O
which O
lead O
us O
to O
think O
that O
CopyPaste O
was O
associated O
with O
cybermercenaries O
or O
a O
training O
center O
. O


At O
the O
end O
of O

, O
the O

We O
also O
unearthed O

our O
other O

, O
such O
as O

Notably O
, O
the O

seems O
to O

We O
also O
observed O
MuddyWater’s B-Organization

Canary’s I-Organization
fraudulent O
history O
can O
be O
traced O
as O
far O
back O
as O
October O
2008 O
, O
when O
the O

first O
arrived O
on O
the O

. O


By O
March O
2016 O
, O
one O
of O
Scattered B-Organization
Canary’s I-Organization
members O
had O
built O
enough O
trust O
with O
a O
romance O
victim—who O
we’ll O
call O
Jane—that O
she O
became O
a O
frequent O
source O
of O
new O

accounts O
for O
the O
group O
. O


Alpha’s B-Organization
early O
role O
was O
fairly O
simple: O
engage O
with O
individuals O
, O
who O
he O
chose O
based O
on O
the O
goods O
they O
were O
selling O
, O
and O

all O

The O
first O
type O
of O

Scattered B-Organization

pivoted O

. O


Between O
July O
2015 O
and O
February O
2016 O
, O
Scattered B-Organization
Canary’s I-Organization
primary O
focus O
seemed O
to O
be O
mass O
harvesting O
general O

using O
a O
Google O

. O


In O
the O
first O
few O
months O
of O
their O

, O
Scattered B-Organization
Canary’s I-Organization
sights O
were O
mostly O

on O
Asian O

, O
in O

. O


In O
November O
2015 O
, O
the O

started O
to O
focus O
on O
North O
American O

, O
mostly O
in O
the O
United O
States O
. O


This O
activity O
ceased O
in O
February O
2016 O
, O
likely O
because O
the O
men O
who O
made O
up O
Scattered B-Organization

began O
to O
focus O
on O

In O

changed O
their O

the O
existence O

which O
we O
attribute O
to O
the O
Sednit B-Organization

If O
Scattered B-Organization
Canary I-Organization
can O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
microcosm O
for O
the O
rapidly O
evolving O
organizations O
behind O
today’s O
most O
pernicious O
email O

, O
this O
report O
demonstrates O
that O
a O
much O
more O
holistic O
approach—one O
based O
on O
threat O
actor O
identity O
rather O
than O
type O
of O
fraudulent O
activity—is O
required O
to O
detect O
email O
fraud O
and O
protect O
organizations O
. O


This O
is O
a O
first O
for O
an O
APT O
group O
, O
and O
shows O
Sednit B-Organization
has O
access O
to O
very O
sophisticated B-Malware
tools I-Malware
to O
conduct O
its O
espionage O
operations O
. O


Three O
years O

, O
the O
Sednit B-Organization

in O
various O
countries O
in O
the O
Middle O

Central O
Asia O
. O


In O
the O
past O
, O
Sednit B-Organization
used O
a O
similar O
technique O
for O
credential O

. O


At O
the O
end O
of O
August O
2018 O
, O
the O
Sednit O

launched O
a O
spearphishing O
email O
campaign O
where O
it O
distributed O

that O
delivered O
the O
first O

as O
tools O
for O
communication O
between O
the O

On O

and O
its O

, O
discovering O
a O
potential O

is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
active O

groups O
operating O
since O
2014 O
, O
it O
has O
traditionally O

In O
2018 O
, O
Kaspersky B-Organization
Labs O
published O
a O
report O
that O
analyzed O
a O
Turla B-Organization
PowerShell B-Malware
loader I-Malware
that O
was O
based O
on O
the O
open-source O
project O
Posh-SecMod O
. O


Turla B-Organization
is O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2008 O
, O
when O
it O
successfully O
breached O
the O
US O
military O
. O


This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Turla B-Organization
has O
used O
PowerShell B-Malware
in-memory O
loaders O
to O
increase O
its O
chances O
of O
bypassing O
security O
products O
. O


However O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
the O
same O
scripts O
are O
used O
more O
globally O
against O
many O
traditional O
Turla B-Organization
targets O
in O
Western O
Europe O
and O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O


In O
some O
samples O
deployed O
since O
March O
2019 O
, O
Turla B-Organization
developers O
modified O
their O
PowerShell O
scripts O
in O
order O
to O
bypass O
the O
Antimalware O
Scan O

( O
AMSI O
) O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
research O
, O
SWEED B-Organization
— O
which O
has O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2017 O
— O
primarily O
targets O
their O
victims O
with O
stealers O
and O
remote O
access O
trojans O
. O


It O
is O
interesting O
to O
note O
that O
Turla B-Organization
operators O
used O
the O
free O
email O
provider O
GMX O
again O
, O
as O
in O
the O
Outlook B-Malware
Backdoor I-Malware
and O
in O
LightNeuron B-Malware
. O


This O
new O
research O
confirms O
our O
forecast O
and O
shows O
that O
the O
Turla B-Organization
group O
does O
not O
hesitate O
to O
use O
open-source O
pen-testing O
frameworks B-Malware
to O
conduct O
intrusion O
. O


Neptun O
is O

on O
Microsoft O

servers O
and O

designed O
to O
passively O
listen O
for O

from O

. O


One O
attack O
during O
this O
campaign O
involved O
the O
use O
of O
infrastructure O
belonging O
to O
another O
espionage O
group O
known O
as O
Crambus B-Organization
aka O
OilRig B-Organization
, O
APT34 B-Organization
. O


Waterbug B-Organization
has O
been O
using O
Meterpreter B-Malware
since O
at O
least O
early O
2018 O
and O
, O
in O
this O
campaign O
, O
used O
a O
modified O
version O
of O
Meterpreter B-Malware
, O
which O
was O
encoded O
and O
given O
a O
.wav O
extension O
in O
order O
to O
disguise O
its O
true O
purpose O
. O


In O
all O
likelihood O
, O
Waterbug’s B-Organization
use O
of O
Crambus B-Malware
infrastructure I-Malware
appears O
to O
have O
been O
a O
hostile O
takeover O
. O


One O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
things O
to O
occur O
during O
one O
of O
Waterbug’s B-Organization
recent O
campaigns O
was O
that O
during O
an O
attack O
against O
one O
target O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
, O
Waterbug B-Organization
appeared O
to O
hijack O
infrastructure O
from O
the O
Crambus O
espionage O
group O
and O
used O
it O
to O
deliver O
malware O
on O
to O
the O
victim’s O
network O
. O


These O
three O
recent O
Waterbug B-Organization
campaigns O
have O
seen O
the O
group O
compromise O
governments O
and O
international O
organizations O
across O
the O
globe O
in O
addition O
to O
targets O
in O
the O
IT O
and O
education O
sectors O
. O


Curiously O
though O
, O
Waterbug B-Organization
also O
compromised O
other O
computers O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
using O
its O
own O
infrastructure O
. O


Symantec B-Organization
believes O
that O
the O
variant O
of O
Mimikatz B-Malware
used O
in O
this O
attack O
is O
unique O
to O
Waterbug B-Organization
. O


Aside O
from O
the O
attack O
involving O
Crambus O
infrastructure O
, O
this O
sample O
of O
Mimikatz B-Malware
has O
only O
been O
seen O
used O
in O
one O
other O
attack O
, O
against O
an O
education O
target O
in O
the O
UK O
in O
2017 O
. O


The O
first O
observed O
evidence O
of O
Waterbug B-Organization
activity O
came O
on O
January O
11 O
, O
2018 O
, O
when O
a O
Waterbug-linked O
tool O
(a O
task O
scheduler O
named O
msfgi.exe O
) O
was O
dropped O
on O
to O
a O
computer O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
. O


In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
attack O
against O
the O
Middle O
Eastern O
target O
, O
Crambus B-Organization
was O
the O
first O
group O
to O
compromise O
the O
victim’s O
network O
, O
with O
the O
earliest O
evidence O
of O
activity O
dating O
to O
November O
2017 O
. O


Waterbug’s B-Organization
intrusions O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
continued O
for O
much O
of O
2018 O
. O


Symantec B-Organization
did O
not O
observe O
the O
initial O
access O
point O
and O
the O
close O
timeframe O
between O
Waterbug B-Organization
observed O
activity O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
and O
its O
observed O
use O
of O
Crambus O
infrastructure O
suggests O
that O
Waterbug B-Organization
may O
have O
used O
the O
Crambus O
infrastructure O
as O
an O
initial O
access O
point O
. O

It O
also O
reconfigures O
the O
Microsoft O
Sysinternals O
registry O
to O
prevent O
pop-ups O
when O
running O
the O
PsExec B-Malware
tool I-Malware
. O


Waterbug B-Organization
also O
used O
an O
older O
version O
of O
PowerShell B-Malware
, O
likely O
to O
avoid O
logging O
. O


In O
one O
of O
these O
campaigns O
, O
Waterbug B-Organization
used O
a O
USB B-Malware
stealer I-Malware
that O
scans O
removable O
storage O
devices O
to O
identify O
and O
collect O
files O
of O
interest O
. O

As O

but O
relies O
on O
the O
additional O

. O

We O
speculate O
that O
other O
attacks O
delivering O
Bookworm B-Malware
were O
also O
targeting O
organizations O
in O
Thailand O
based O
on O
the O
contents O
of O

may O
use O
the O

a O

identifier O
. O

Due O
to O
these O
changes O
without O
a O
new O

string O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
date O
codes O
are O
used O
for O
campaign O
tracking O
rather O
than O
a O

build O
identifier O
. O

Another O
decoy O

, O
then O
the O

contained O
instructions O
for O
enabling O
macros O

The O
executable O
would O
install O
the O

but O
would O
also O
launch O
a O

Careto O

on O
spear-phishing O

Sometimes O
, O
the O

use O

to O
make O

seem O
more O

We O
initially O
became O
aware O
of O
Careto O
when O
we O
observed O
attempts O
to O
exploit B-Vulnerability
a O

in O
our O

to O
make O
the O

The O

is O

that O
is O

The O

that O

be O
politically O

Lately O

has O
been O

CVE-2017-8570 O
. O

The O
first O
of O
which O
we O
call O
' O
CONFUCIUS_A O
' O
, O
a O
malware O
family O
that O
has O
links O
to O
a O
series O
of O

associated O
with O
a O

method O
commonly O
known O
as O
SNEEPY B-Malware
( O
aka O
ByeByeShell B-Malware
) O
first O
reported O
by O
Rapid7 B-Organization
in O
2013 O
. O

At O
first O
glance O
CONFUCIUS_B O
looks O
very O
similar O
to O
CONFUCIUS_A O
, O
and O
they O
are O
also O
packaged O
in O
plain O
SFX B-Malware
binary I-Malware
files I-Malware
. O

The O
CONFUCIUS_B O
executable O
is O
disguised O
as O

presentation O
, O
using O
a O
Right-To-Left-Override O
( O
RTLO O
) O
trick O
and O
a O
false O

. O

We O
also O
believe O
that O
both O
clusters O
of O
activity O
have O
links O
to O
attacks O
with O
likely O
Indian O
origins O
, O
the O
CONFUCIUS_A O
attacks O
are O
linked O
to O
the O
use O
of O
SNEEPY/BYEBYESHELL B-Malware
and O
the O
CONFUCIUS_B O
have O
a O
loose O
link O
to O
Hangover B-Malware
. O

The O
two O
malware O
families O
themselves O
are O
also O
very O
similar O
, O
and O
therefore O
we O
think O
that O
the O
shared O
technique O
is O
an O
indication O
of O
a O
single O
developer O
, O
or O
development O
company O
, O
behind O
both O
CONFUCIUS_A O
and O
CONFUCIUS_B O
. O

The O

Bisonal B-Organization
malware I-Organization
in O

the O

Let’s O
take O

that O

relevant O
to O
the O

Based O
on O
this O

we O
believe O
the O
Rancor B-Organization

were O

Other O

The O
most O
recent O
Scarlet O

we O
have O
identified O

the O

that O

We O
noted O
in O
our O
original O
blog O
the O
large O
amount O
of O
targeting O
of O
Iranian O
citizens O
in O
this O
campaign O
, O
we O
observed O
almost O
one-third O
of O
all O
victims O
to O
be O
Iranian O
. O

Since O
early O
2013 O
, O
we O
have O
observed O
activity O
from O
a O
unique O
threat O
actor O
group O
, O
which O
we O
began O
to O
investigate O
based O
on O
increased O
activities O
against O
human O
right O
activists O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
2015 O
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
three O
years O
of O
observation O
of O
campaigns O
targeting O
civil O
society O
and O
human O
rights O
organizations O
, O
from O
records O
of O
well O
over O
two O
hundred O
spearphishing O
and O
other O
intrusion O
attempts O
against O
individuals O
inside O
of O
Iran O
and O
in O
the O
diaspora O
, O
a O
narrative O
of O
persistent O
intrusion O
efforts O
emerges O
. O

Over O
the O
months O
following O
the O
elections O
, O
the O
accounts O
of O
Iranians O
that O
had O
been O
compromised O
by O
the O
actors O
were O
then O
used O
for O
spreading O
the O
malware O
. O

The O
Infy B-Malware
malware B-Malware
was O
seen O
targeting O
Iranians O
again O
in O
June O
2015 O
, O
when O
it O
was O
shared O
with O
researchers O
after O
being O
sent O
to O
a O
broadcast O
journalist O
at O
BBC O
Persian O
with O
a O
generic O
introduction O
and O
a O
PowerPoint O
presentation O
attached O
titled O
" O
Nostalogy O
" O
( O
sic O
) O
. O

One O
narrowly-targeted O
spearphishing O
from O
Infy O
was O
sent O
from O
the O
compromised O
account O
of O
a O
political O
activist O
promoting O
participation O
inside O
of O
Iran O
, O
claiming O
to O
be O
a O
set O
of O

of O
a O
British-Iranian O
dual O
national O
that O
has O
been O
held O
in O

for O
five O
years O
on O

charges O
. O

As O
in O
the O
past O
, O
these O
messages O
have O
been O
sent O
accounts O
believed O
to O
be O
fake O
and O
accounts O
compromised O
by O
Infy O
, O
including O
Kurdish O
activists O
that O

previously O

. O

LEAD O
and O
Barium B-Organization
are O
not O
known O
for O
large-scale O
spear-phishing O
, O
so O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
SOC O
personnel O
would O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
multiple O
machines O
having O
been O
compromised O
by O
these O
groups O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

While O
the O
machine O
is O
in O
isolation O
, O
SOC O
personnel O
can O
direct O
the O
infected O
machine O
to O
collect O
live O
investigation O
data O
, O
such O
as O
the O
DNS O
cache O
or O
security O
event O

, O
which O
they O
can O
use O
to O
verify O
alerts O
, O
assess O
the O
state O
of O
the O
intrusion O
, O
and O
support O
follow-up O
actions O
. O

The O
samples O
provided O
were O
alleged O
to O
be O
targeting O
Tibetan O
and O
Chinese O
Pro-Democracy O
Activists O
. O

They O
are O
often O
targeted O
simultaneously O
with O
other O
ethnic O
minorities O
and O
religious O
groups O
in O
China O
. O

Examples O
as O
early O
as O
2008 O
document O
malware O
operations O
against O
Tibetan O
non-governmental O
organizations O
( O
NGOs O
) O
that O
also O
targeted O
Falun O

and O
Uyghur O
groups O
. O

recently O
identified O
a O
targeted O
attack O
against O
an O
individual O
working O
for O
the O
Foreign O
Ministry O
of O
Uzbekistan O
in O
China O
. O

NetTraveler B-Malware
has O
been O
used O
to O
target O
diplomats O
, O
embassies O
and O
government O
institutions O
for O
over O
a O
decade O
, O
and O
remains O
the O
tool O
of O
choice O
by O
the O
adversaries O
behind O
these O
cyber O
espionage O
campaigns O
. O

The O
NetTraveler O
group O
has O
infected O
victims O
across O
multiple O
establishments O
in O
both O
the O
public O
and O
private O
sector O
including O
government O
institutions O
, O
embassies O
, O
the O
oil O
and O
gas O
industry O
, O
research O
centers O
, O
military O
contractors O
and O
activists O
. O

The O
main O
point O
that O
sets O
Operation O
Groundbait O
apart O
from O
the O
other O
attacks O
is O
that O
it O
has O
mostly O
been O
targeting O
anti-government O
separatists O
in O
the O
self-declared O
Donetsk O
and O
Luhansk O
People O
's O
Republics O
. O

Although O
Silence O

phishing O
emails O
were O
also O
sent O
to O
bank O
employees O
in O
Central O
and O
Western O
Europe O
, O
Africa O
, O
and O
Asia O
) O
. O

They O
tried O
new O
techniques O
to O
steal O
from O
banking O
systems O
, O
including O
AWS O
CBR O
( O
the O
Russian O
Central O
Bank O
's O
Automated O
Workstation O
Client O
) O
, O
ATMs O
, O
and O
card O
processing O
. O

However O
, O
some O
phishing O
emails O
were O
sent O
to O
bank O
employees O
in O
more O
than O
25 O
countries O
of O
Central O
and O
Western O
Europe O
, O
Africa O
and O
Asia O
including O
: O
Kyrgyzstan O
, O
Armenia O

, O
and O
others O
. O

An O
interesting O
point O
in O
the O
Silence O
attack O
is O
that O
the O
cybercriminals O
had O
already O
compromised O
banking O
infrastructure O
in O
order O
to O
send O
their O
spear-phishing O
emails O
from O
the O
addresses O
of O
real O
bank O
employees O
and O
look O
as O
unsuspicious O
as O
possible O
to O
future O
victims O
. O

A O
preliminary O
analysis O
caught O
the O
attention O
of O
our O
Threat O
Analysis O
and O
Intelligence O
team O
as O
it O
yielded O
interesting O
data O
that O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
shows O
that O
Silence O
was O
targeting O
employees O
from O
financial O
entities O
, O
specifically O
in O
the O
Russian O
Federation O
and O
the O

of O

While O
the O

could O
similarly O

its O

more O

the O

For O
the O
sake O
of O

we O
are O

to O

to O
those O

we O
identified O

in O

After O
reviewing O
all O
the O
malware O
functionalities O
, O
we O
are O
confident O
in O
saying O
that O
the O
attackers B-Organization
look O
for O
victims O
who O
answer O
well-defined O
characteristics O
and O
believe O
that O
further O
stages O
of O
the O

are O
delivered O
only O
to O
those O
who O
fit O
the O

Through O

by O

with O
LYCEUM’s B-Organization
targeting O
of O

Despite O
the O

that O

database O
of O
up O
to O
85 O
, O

. O

Group-IB B-Organization

that O
the O

Based O
on O

we O

the O

The O
most O

In O

We O

the O
large O
amount O
of O
targeting O
of O

citizens O
in O
this O
campaign O
, O
we O
observed O
almost O
one-third O
of O
all O

Since O
early O
2013 O
, O
we O
have O
observed O
activity O
from O
a O
unique O
threat O
actor O

, O
which O
we O
began O
to O
investigate O
based O
on O
increased O
activities O
against O
human O

in O
the O
beginning O
of O
2015 O

Over O

of O
three O
years O
of O
observation O
of O
campaigns O
targeting O

from O
records O
of O

over O
two O
hundred O
spearphishing O
and O
other O
intrusion O
attempts O
against O
individuals O
inside O
of O
Iran O
and O
in O
the O

, O
a O
narrative O
of O
persistent O
intrusion O
efforts O
emerges O
. O

Over O
the O
months O
following O
the O
elections O
, O
the O
accounts O
of O
Iranians O
that O
had O
been O
compromised O
by O
the O
actors O
were O
then O
used O
for O
spreading O
the O
malware O
. O

The O
Infy B-Malware
malware B-Malware
was O
seen O
targeting O
Iranians O
again O
in O
June O
2015 O
, O
when O
it O
was O
shared O
with O
researchers O
after O
being O
sent O
to O
a O

at O
BBC O

with O
a O
generic O
introduction O
and O
a O
PowerPoint O

attached O
titled O
" O
Nostalogy O
" O
( O
sic O
) O
. O

One O
narrowly-targeted O
spearphishing O
from O
Infy O
was O
sent O
from O
the O
compromised O
account O
of O
a O
political O
activist O
promoting O
participation O
inside O

, O
claiming O

LEAD O
and O
Barium B-Organization
are O
not O
known O
for O
large-scale O
spear-phishing O
, O
so O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
SOC O

would O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
multiple O
machines O
having O
been O
compromised O
by O
these O

at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

While O
the O
machine O
is O
in O

can O
direct O

collect O
live O

such O
as O

The O

were O
alleged O
to O

They O
are O
often O

simultaneously O
with O

. O

NetTraveler B-Malware
has O
been O
used O
to O
target O
diplomats O
, O

and O
government O
institutions O
for O
over O
a O
decade O
, O
and O
remains O
the O
tool O
of O
choice O
by O
the O
adversaries O
behind O
these O
cyber O

The O
NetTraveler O

has O
infected O

both O
the O

, O
the O
oil O
and O
gas O
industry O
, O
research O
centers O
, O
military O
contractors O
and O
activists O
. O

The O
main O
point O
that O
sets O
Operation O
Groundbait O
apart O
from O
the O
other O
attacks O
is O
that O
it O
has O
mostly O
been O
targeting O
anti-government O
separatists O
in O
the O
self-declared O
Donetsk O
and O
Luhansk O
People O

. O

Although O

emails O
were O
also O
sent O
to O
bank O
employees O
in O
Central O
and O
Western O
Europe O
, O
Africa O
, O
and O

) O
. O

They O
tried O
new O
techniques O
to O
steal O

including O

CBR O

the O
Russian O
Central O
Bank O

Automated O
Workstation O
Client O
) O
, O
ATMs O
, O
and O

processing O
. O

However O
, O
some O
phishing O
emails O
were O
sent O
to O
bank O
employees O
in O
more O
than O
25 O
countries O
of O
Central O
and O
Western O
Europe O
, O
Africa O
and O
Asia O
including O

and O
others O
. O

An O
interesting O
point O
in O
the O
Silence O
attack O
is O
that O
the O
cybercriminals O
had O
already O
compromised O
banking O
infrastructure O
in O
order O
to O
send O
their O
spear-phishing O
emails O
from O
the O
addresses O
of O
real O

and O
look O
as O
unsuspicious O
as O
possible O
to O
future O
victims O
. O

A O
preliminary O
analysis O
caught O
the O
attention O
of O
our O
Threat O
Analysis O
and O
Intelligence O
team O
as O
it O
yielded O
interesting O
data O
that O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
shows O
that O
Silence O
was O
targeting O
employees O
from O
financial O
entities O
, O
specifically O
in O
the O
Russian O
Federation O
and O
the O

of O
Belarus O

While O
the O

could O
similarly O
originate O

it O

Given O
its O
use O
in O
more O
advanced O
social O

campaigns O
against O

, O
the O
label O
seem O
particularly O
apt O

several O
of O
these O

the O

For O
the O
sake O
of O
narrative O
we O
are O

to O
those O

identified O

After O
reviewing O
all O
the O

, O
we O
are O
confident O
in O
saying O
that O
the O
attackers B-Organization
look O
for O
victims O
who O
answer O
well-defined O
characteristics O
and O
believe O
that O
further O
stages O
of O
the O

are O
delivered O
only O
to O
those O
who O
fit O
the O
specific O
victim O

OSX_DOK.C B-Malware
first O
arrives O
via O
a O
phishing O
email O
that O
contains O
certain O
files O
labeled O
as O
either O
.zip O
or O
.docx O
files O
. O

The O
sample O
we O
analyzed O
was O
a O
purported O
message O
from O
a O
police O
inspector O
in O
Zurich O
allegedly O
claiming O
to O
unsuccessfully O
contact O
the O

The O

also O
comes O
with O
two O
files O
attached O
claiming O
to O
contain O
questions O
for O
the O
user O
: O
one O
is O
a O
.zip O

, O
which O
is O
a O
fake O
OS O

, O
while O
the O
other O
is O
a O
.docx O
file O
used O
to O
target O
Windows B-System
operating O
systems O
using O
WERDLOD B-Malware
. O

Both O
of O
these O
samples O
work O
as O
Banking B-Malware
Trojans I-Malware
and O
provide O
similar O
functionalities O
. O

Some O
examples O
of O
the O
files O
used O
in O
the O
email O

include O
the O
following O
: O
01.06.2017.zip O

Once O
the O

file O
included O
in O
the O
phishing O
email O
is O
clicked O
, O
a O
warning O
window O
will O
pop O
up O
. O

After O
this O
, O
the O
App O

will O
be O
removed O
, O
followed O
by O
a O
full O
screen O
fake O
OS B-System
X I-System
update O
screen O
. O

It O
will O
ask O
for O
a O
password O
to O
run O
command O
as O
root O
. O

The O
malware O
will O
begin O
to O
download O
other O
utilities O
. O

It O
relies O
on O
Homebrew O
, O
an O
open O
source O
software O
package O
manager O
to O
install O
Golang O
and O
Tor O
. O

The O
malware O
will O
then O
install O
fake O
certificates O
in O
the O
system O
to O
perform O
a O
MitM O
attack O
without O
notifying O
the O
user O
. O

The O
structure O
of O
the O
fake O
App O
Store O
matches O
the O
application O
bundle O
structure O
and O
provides O
both O
English O
and O
German O

. O

The O
archive O
in O
Mac B-System
OS I-System

looks O
like O
this O
: O
OS I-System
X I-System
will O
run O
the O
application O
if O
it O
passes O

. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
malware O
is O
signed O
off O
by O
a O
“ O

” O
, O
which O
may O
actually O
be O
a O

In O

, O
the O

which O
might O
mean O
that O

obtained O
specifically O
for O
this O
attack O
. O

The O
fake O

imitates O
the O
COMODO O

. O

Take O
note O
that O
the O
fake O
certificate O
does O
not O
contain O
a O
COMODO O
Certificate O
Authority O
seal O
that O
certifies O
its O
validity O
, O
as O
seen O
in O
the O
comparison O
below O
: O
noticed O
that O
this O

will O
not O
work O
for O

There O
is O
a O

shortcut O
embedded O
in O
the O
malicious O

that O
will O
download O
an O
executable O
file O
from O
Dropbox O
that O
executes O
once O
clicked O
by O
the O
user O
. O

The O
functionalities O
are O
similar O
to O
the O
malicious B-Malware
app I-Malware
provided O
, O
which O
includes O
installing O
tor O
and O

. O

We O
have O
already O
notified O

the O
use O
of O
its O
service O
for O
this O
malware O
. O

Dropbox O
has O
already O
taken O

The O
malware O
will O
install O
two O
proxies O
running O
on O
local O
host O
port O
5555 O
and O
5588 O
. O

All O
of O
the O

will O
be O
hijacked O
into O
the O
first O
proxy O
( O
port O
5555 O
) O
with O
the O
victim O
’s O
external O
IP O
address O
as O
parameter O
. O

The O
first O
( O
port O
5555 O
) O
proxy O
first O
finds O
the O
IP O
parameter O
. O

If O
it O
is O
not O
in O
Switzerland O
, O
the O
traffic O
will O
proceed O
as O
normal O
. O

If O
it O
detects O
an O
IP O
located O
in O
Switzerland O
, O
the O
malware B-Malware
will I-Malware
run O
an O
obfuscated O
JavaScript O
code O
and O
find O
its O
visiting O
domain O
. O

If O
the O
domain O
is O
in O
the O
target O
, O
the O
malware O
will O
perform O
a O
MitM O
attack O
and O
redirect O
the O
traffic O
to O
the O
second O
proxy O
( O
port O
5588 O
) O
, O
which O
routes O
the O
traffic O
to O
the O
Tor O
network O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
these O
steps O
is O
to O
target O
users O
in O
Switzerland O
and O
hijack O
their O
traffic O
After O
deobfuscating O
the O
malware O
, O
we O
found O
the O
target O
domains O
: O
target O
domain O
’s O
visitors O
will O
be O
redirected O
into O
an O
e-banking O
login O
page O
that O
looks O
and O
acts O
normally O
, O
but O
is O
located O
on O
dark O
web O
sites O
. O

However O
, O
once O
the O
victim O
enters O
an O
account O
and O
password O
. O

A O
window O
will O
pop O
out O
. O

The O
pop-out O
window O
is O
just O
smoke O
and O
mirrors O
, O
where O
nothing O
actually O
happens O
once O
the O
countdown O
timer O
reaches O
zero O
. O

We O
analyzed O
the O
webpage O
and O
found O
attackers O
injecting O
a O
script O
into O
the O
webpage O
. O

Once O
the O
user O
enters O
an O
account O
and O
password O
, O
it O
will O
initiate O
POST O
using O
AJAX O
. O

The O
POST O
message O
is O
sent O
to O
the O
same O
site O
as O
the O
fake O
login O
page—which O
an O
attacker O
can O
control O
inside O
the O
Tor O
network O
. O

We O
decoded O
the O
data O
section O
and O
found O
not O
only O
the O
account O
and O
password O
, O
but O
that O
it O
also O
fingerprinted O
the O
user O
’s O
browser O
and O
system O
information O
. O

While O
Operation O
Emmental O
was O
able O
to O
bypass O
two-way O
authentication O
by O
tricking O
its O
victims O
into O
installing O
a O
fake O
app O
, O
we O
have O
not O
observed O
OSX_DOK.C B-Malware
doing O
this O
. O

However O
, O
since O
they O
can O
inject O
code O
into O
the O
webpage O
, O
it O
means O
they O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
do O
this O
as O
well O
. O

We O
performed O
static O
analysis O
on O
the O
sample O
and O
found O
it O
packed O
by O
Ultimate O
Packer O
for O
Executables O
( O
UPX O
) O
, O
an O
open O
source O
executable O
packer O
that O
can O
often O
be O
abused O
by O
malware B-Malware
. O

We O
successfully O
unpacked O
the O
initial O
sample O
we O
found O
dropped O
by O
the O
UPX O
unpacker O
. O

The O
malware B-Malware
is O
not O
obfuscated O
so O
we O
easily O
found O
interesting O
strings O
here O
. O

We O
can O
see O
that O
the O
malware B-Malware
relies O
on O
bash O
shell O
for O
most O
of O
its O
setup O
. O

We O
were O
not O
able O
to O
unpack O
the O
sample O
discovered O
after O
June O
9 O
, O
2017 O
. O

The O
UPX O
gave O
a O
warning O
message O
about O
memory O
buffer O
overflow O
. O

The O
malware B-Malware
author O
seemingly O
made O
unpacking O
the O
malware O
more O
difficult O
to O
slow O
down O
or O
even O
evade O
the O
antivirus O
engine O
’s O
scanning O
process O
. O

The O
packer O
is O
the O
same O
but O
the O
malware O
tries O
to O
exploit O
the O
undiscovered O
bug O
in O
the O
UPX O
library O
that O
causes O
unpack O
failure O
. O

We O
have O
reported O
the O
issues O
to O
the O
UPX O
team O
, O
and O
they O
have O
already O
fixed O
it O
. O

The O
impacted O
versions O
of O
the O
UPX O
library O
are O
3.94 O
, O
3.93 O
, O
and O
3.92 O
. O

This O
technique O
enables O
the O
malware O
to O
efficiently O
run O
while O
evading O
unpacking O
techniques O
from O
the O
AntiVirus-integrated O
UPX O
library O
. O

As O
mentioned O
earlier O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
OSX_DOK.C B-Malware
might O
be O
the O
MAC B-System
OS O
X O
version O
of O
WERDLOD B-Malware
, O
an O
online O
banking O
malware B-Malware
that O
used O
the O
same O
techniques O
as O
Operation O
Emmental O
. O

Other O
research O
have O
also O
connected O
the O
OSX B-System
malware O
and O
Retefe O
( O
the O
external O
term O
used O
for O
WERDLOD B-Malware
) O
via O
similarities O
in O
their O
behavior O
. O

While O
OSX_DOK.C B-Malware
is O
designed O
for O
MAC O
OS O
X O
, O
which O
is O
a O
Unix-like O
system O
, O
WERDLOD B-Malware
is O
designed O
for O

. O

But O
in O
terms O
of O
features O
and O
behaviors O
, O
these O
two O
malware O
are O
very O
similar O
. O

Here O
is O
a O
list O
of O
their O
similarities O
. O

Both O
malware O
kill O
all O
current O
browsers O
before O
installing O
fake O

: O
WERDLOD B-Malware
and O
OSX_DOK.C B-Malware
are O
designed O
to O
kill O
the O

While O
WERDLOD B-Malware
kills O
processes O
for O
Internet O

, O
Firefox O
, O
and O
Chrome O
, O
OSX_DOK.C B-Malware
does O
the O
same O
on O
Safari O
, O
Firefox O
, O
and O
Chrome O
. O

Both O
malware B-Malware
share O
the O
same O
proxy O
settings O
and O
script O
: O
WERDLOD B-Malware
and O
OSX_DOK.C B-Malware
use O
different O
codes O
( O
since O
they O
target O
different O
operating O
systems O
) O
, O
they O
have O
similar O
proxy O
settings O
and O
script O
formats O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
WERDLOD B-Malware
uses O
scripts O
running O
on O
http://127.0.0.1:5555/#{random_string}.js?ip=#{my_ip} O
as O
proxy O
: O
it O
to O
OSX_DOK.C B-Malware
, O
we O
can O
see O
that O
it O
uses O
the O
same O
script O
format O
. O

Both O
malware B-Malware
have O
similar O
targets O
. O

Both O
WERDLOD B-Malware
and O
OSX_DOK.C B-Malware
targeted O
financial O
institutions O
, O
with O
a O
particular O
focus O
on O
banks O
in O
Switzerland O
. O

Further O
analysis O
of O
both O
malware B-Malware
revealed O
that O
their O
main O
targets O
are O
very O
similar O
, O
as O
seen O
in O
the O
screenshot O
below O
. O

While O
it O
’s O
possible O
that O
this O
is O
a O
coincidence O
, O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
evidence O
makes O
it O
unlikely O
for O
these O
two O
malware B-Malware
to O
target O
the O

by O
chance O
. O

Given O
the O
connection O
between O

, O
it O
is O
reasonable O
to O
assume O
that O

According O
to O
the O

In O
the O
case O
of O
this O

, O
the O
activity O
groups O
strongly O
associated O
with O

are O
BARIUM B-Organization

But O
even O
though O

the O
BARIUM B-Organization
and O
LEAD B-Organization
activity O
groups O
are O
involved O
in O
very O
different O
intrusion O
scenarios O
. O

BARIUM B-Organization
begins O
its O

with O
potential O
victims—particularly O
those O
working O
in O
Business O

or O
Human O

various O
social O

Once O

The O

recorded O
to O
date O
have O
been O
in O

, O
although O
occasional O

have O
occurred O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
LEAD B-Organization
has O
established O
a O
far O
greater O
reputation O
for O
industrial O
espionage O
. O

In O
the O
past O
few O
years O
, O
LEAD B-Organization
’s O
victims O
have O
included O
: O
, O
multi-industry O

During O
these O

was O
to O

. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
LEAD B-Organization

attacks O
do O
not O
feature O
any O

. O

The O

also O
does O
not O
make O
special O
effort O
to O
cultivate O
victims O
prior O
to O
an O

. O

Instead O
, O
the O

often O
simply O
emails O
a O

, O
relying O
on O
basic O

In O
some O
other O

by O
brute-forcing O
remote O

, O
performing O
SQL O

, O
or O
exploiting O

and O
then O
they O
copy O
the O

directly O
to O

, O
the O
Middle O

the O
United O

in O

six O
months O
. O

The O
most O
recent O
series O
of O
attacks O
observed O
was O
in O
December O
2016 O
. O

Although O
tracking O
threats O
like O
Winnti B-Malware
involves O
old-fashioned O
investigative O
work O
, O
Microsoft O
Threat O
Intelligence O
analysts O
take O
advantage O
of O
machine O
learning O
to O
work O
at O
scale O
. O

When O
attackers O
used O
Winnti B-Malware
to O
maintain O
access O
to O
web O
servers O
, O
they O
hid O
the O
implant O
in O
plain O
sight O
by O
masquerading O
it O
as O
a O
trusted O
, O
legitimate O
file O
. O

This O
was O
the O
case O
in O
two O
known O
intrusions O
in O
2015 O
, O
where O
attackers O
named O
the O
implant O
DLL O
“ O
ASPNET_FILTER.DLL O
” O
to O
disguise O
it O
as O
the O
DLL O
for O
the O
ASP.NET O
ISAPI O
Filter O
. O

Although O
there O
are O
obvious O
differences O
between O
the O
legitimate O
file O
and O
the O
malicious O
one O
, O
filtering O
out O
the O
malicious O
file O
would O
involve O
going O
through O
a O
data O
set O
with O
noise O
from O
millions O
of O
possible O
file O
names O
, O
software O
publishers O
, O
and O

. O

Microsoft O
researchers O
used O
a O
combination O
of O
anomaly O

and O
supervised O

learning O
to O
reduce O
the O
