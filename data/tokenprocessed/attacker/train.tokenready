Over O

that O
we O
called O

( O
also O
known O
as O
SocGholish B-MALWARE

that O
used B-ATTACK_PATTERN

. O

As O
we O
have O
seen O
over O
the O
years O
, O
SocGholish B-MALWARE
is O
an O
established O

that O
has O
managed O
to O
compromise O
countless O

after O

the O

The O
new O

which O
we O
call O

to O
be O
a O
newcomer O
, O
it O
uses O
different O
layers O

techniques O
that O
make O
it O
a O

to O
take O
seriously O
and O
which O
could O
potentially O
rival O

very O

Instead O
, O
victims B-VICTIM_IDENTITY
would O
end O
up O
infecting O
their O
computers O
with O
the O
NetSupport B-ATTACK_TOOL
RAT I-ATTACK_TOOL
, O
allowing O
threat O
actors O
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
and O
deliver O
additional O
payloads O
. O

As O
we O
have O
seen O
over O
the O
years O
, O
SocGholish B-MALWARE
is O
an O
established O
player O
that O
has O
managed O
to O
compromise O
countless O
victims O
and O
deliver O
ransomware O
after O
facilitating O
the O
installation O
of O
tools O
like O
Cobalt B-ATTACK_TOOL
Strike I-ATTACK_TOOL
or O
Mimikatz B-ATTACK_TOOL
. O

The O
new O
campaign B-CAMPAIGN
, O
which O
we O
call O
FakeSG B-MALWARE
, O
also O
relies O
on O
hacked B-INFRASTRUCTURE
WordPress I-INFRASTRUCTURE
websites I-INFRASTRUCTURE
to O
display O
a O
custom O
landing O
page O
mimicking O
the O
victim O
's O
browser O
. O

The O
threat B-THREAT_ACTOR
actors I-THREAT_ACTOR
are O
distributing O
NetSupport B-ATTACK_TOOL
RAT I-ATTACK_TOOL
either O
as O
a O
zipped O
download O
or O
via O
an O
Internet O
shortcut O
. O

While O
FakeSG B-MALWARE
appears O
to O
be O
a O
newcomer O
, O
it O
uses O
different O
layers O
of O
obfuscation O
and O
delivery O
techniques O
that O
make O
it O
a O
threat O
to O
take O
seriously O
and O
which O
could O
potentially O
rival O
with O
SocGholish B-MALWARE
. O

We O
first O
heard O
of O
this O
new O
campaign B-CAMPAIGN
thanks O
to O
a O
Mastodon B-GENERAL_IDENTITY
post O
by O
Randy B-GENERAL_IDENTITY
McEoin I-GENERAL_IDENTITY
. O

The O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
are O
very O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
SocGholish B-MALWARE
and O
it O
would O
be O
easy O
to O
think O
the O
two O
are O
related O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
chain O
also O
leads O
to O
NetSupport B-ATTACK_TOOL
RAT I-ATTACK_TOOL
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
call O
this O
variant O
FakeSG B-MALWARE
